    "description": "The Eternal Tides is a momentous occasion—an adventure in beauty unlike anything seen before on the PuSh stage. In her Canadian debut, choreographer Lin Lee-Chen folds age-old rituals, customs and ceremonial rites into her radical vision, and the result is epic. The show is, above all, a tribute to water: the ocean that encloses the island of Taiwan, and the cycle of renewal it is part of. Using song, dance and striking stage design, Lin evokes the mythology of these elements. You might call it spiritual environmentalism—a tribute to nature as it was, and might be again.

With its large ensemble of dancers and musicians, the show has an intoxicating power. Lin carries us through a procession of vivid tableaux; the imagery evokes myth and human reality in equal measure. The costumes and sets are stunning: fabric and silver grass, red-tinted figures and shocks of white, composed with flair and delicacy. At once austere and sensual, intimate and monumental, this show will leave you awestruck.",

    "description": "MEL GAUSDEN | GIRLS GONE WILD
BAU-XI VANCOUVER UPPER GALLERY | JANUARY 13 - 27
Opening Reception: Saturday, January 13, 2-4PM 
ARTIST IN ATTENDANCE

Canadian landscape painting has mythologized the great outdoors through the work of Tom Thomson, A.Y. Jackson and David Milne. As a genre historically dominated by male painters, emerging artist Mel Gausden marks a departure from the landscape tradition by centralizing the experience of women in nature, and her own in ﻿Girls Gone Wild, the artist's inaugural exhibition at Bau-Xi Vancouver.

Typically overlooked in traditional landscape painting, Gausden's canvases feature women as outdoors people: active participants who build fires, climb fences, and carry their own canoes. Her female subjects, often situated or leaving evidence of their trace, discover themselves within the natural environment in which they gather, explore and commune.

The visual culture of our contemporary digital age informs Gausden's unconventional palette. Neon silhouettes and brightly hued accents take reference from pre-set Instagram camera filters, fashion and consumer trends. The artist's manipulation of oil paint varies from sculptural— bending and piling thick layers of paint into matchsticks of textured impasto—to painterly— diluting paint until it drips with controlled precision— to sketchlike with her mark-making. For Gausden, the act of painting is intuitive as much as it is intentional; an exploratory act of personal and cultural identity which fuses past and present influences to create new possibilities for representation.

ABOUT THE ARTIST

Mel Gausden explores themes of personal and cultural identity through traditions of self-portraiture and landscape painting. Her interests lie in combining visual markers and signifiers of nostalgia and Canadiana with painterly gesture, mark-making and bold highlights. The artist applies neon silhouettes evocative of “instagram-esque” colour filters to highlight the inherent distortion of our own personal narratives. In the end, these visual narratives end up as hybrids, part-reality and part-dreamscape.

Mel Gausden earned her Bachelor’s of Arts at the Ontario College of Art and Design in 2009. She continues to live and work out of her studio in Toronto.",

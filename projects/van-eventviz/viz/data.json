Carol Sawyer: The Natalie Brettschneider Archive presents the latest findings of this ongoing research project that deftly reconstructs the life and work of the genre-defying, fictional artist Natalie Brettschneider.Beginning with her childhood in New Westminster, through her travels in Canada and Europe and her eventual return to British Columbia, real people, places and events are woven throughout Brettschneider’s story. The photographs, letters, paintings, films and other materials on view connect Natalie Brettschneider to a rich community of interdisciplinary women artists working in Europe and British Columbia from the 1920s to the 1970s. The practices of these artists were often under-represented in institutional collections and largely excluded from historical accounts of modernist art history in this region. By using a fictional character to draw attention to the work of these artists, Sawyer opens this period up to a reconsideration of the diverse practices, subjects and actors that shaped the course of mid-century modernism in this region and in many ways set the stage for the interdisciplinary practices of the 1960s and 70s.Carol Sawyer: The Natalie Brettschneider Archive features works from the Vancouver Art Gallery’s permanent collection alongside artworks and archival materials borrowed from regional and national galleries, archives and private lenders.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2830077,"lng":-123.1208179},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28435668029149,"lng":-123.1194689197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2816587197085,"lng":-123.1221668802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"750 Hornby St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 2H7, Canada"},{"id":"1027621","tags":["Nightlife"],"name":"Grand Opening of the New REP/Thursday","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/02/27332238_1666074756785800_4339965607709010127_n.jpg?itok=YCaS2e_t","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/02/27332238_1666074756785800_4339965607709010127_n.jpg?itok=M7gVpSnB"],"endDate":"2018-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-15T00:00:00-08:00","description":"$oulgood Presents...THE ALL NEW THURSDAY NIGHT EXPERIENCE CONTINUING THE LEGACY OF THURSDAYS BY SOULGOOD.Introducing:REP/THURSDAYS at REPUBLIC; Representing All Things Nightlife.GRAND OPENING THURSDAY, FEBRUARY.15THFeaturing:2 Rooms for DOUBLE The Pleasure with Residents Physik.

The project features over 650 images of street demonstrations, protests, and riots from the early 1900s to present day from the archives of the Vancouver Sun and The Province newspapers. These photos capture emotionally raw and transformative moments in the lives of Vancouverites. Large digital projections and films coupled with animated sounds of protest choirs will create an immersive environment that will inspire the public to think about the impact of grassroots activism in their lives. From the shore workers’ strike at the Battle of Ballantyne Pier in 1935 to rallying of anti-logging groups at Clayoquot Sound in 1993, these records demonstrate the power of “ordinary people” in mobilizing public opinion and effecting change locally and globally.For more info, visit museumofvancouver.ca","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.27676580000001,"lng":-123.1436829},"southwest":{"lat":49.2759675,"lng":-123.1452026}},"location":{"lat":49.2763667,"lng":-123.1444427},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2777156302915,"lng":-123.1430937697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.27501766970851,"lng":-123.1457917302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1100 Chestnut St, Vancouver, BC V6J 3J9, Canada"},{"id":"1010851","tags":["Galleries","Other"],"name":"Art Rental Show","endDate":"2018-02-03T00:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2017-12-21T00:00:00-08:00","description":"*Please join us for our big opening night on Thursday, January 11th from 7:00-9:00pm* This event will be free.Featuring 200 new artworks by local artists!From dramatic landscapes, bold abstracts, exquisitely detailed oil, and fantastical photography, every medium, style, and subject is explored.

The exhibition will open on Saturday, January 13th, 2018 and will run until February 3th, 2018.Amanda Smart grew up on the Sunshine Coast where she first discovered her love of painting and nature. After travelling and living in South America, moved back to Vancouver where she attended Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design. Generally using traditional oil medium, she has developed a more realistically inclined style with hints of dreaminess and ethereality. Amanda aims to explore our natural surroundings while at the same time composing comparisons to our own experiences and conditions as humans. Amanda hopes to continue to use her commitment to her painting as a way to study, learn and explore where we live and our own relationships to that.Please join us at the Deer Lake Gallery for the OPENING RECEPTION of Bodies of Salt on Saturday, January 13th, 2018 @ 12 pm.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.239272,"lng":-122.968702},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2406209802915,"lng":-122.9673530197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2379230197085,"lng":-122.9700509802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"6584 Deer Lake Ave, Burnaby, BC V5G 3T7, Canada"},{"id":"1021506","tags":["Theatre"],"name":"Pourquoi tu pleures…?","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/listing_gs-ptp_0.jpg?itok=XflGc6zy","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/listing_gs-ptp_0.jpg?itok=JFq-D0Gv"],"endDate":"2018-02-17T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-16T20:00:00-08:00","description":"The death of an overbearing father, an inheritance worth more than five million dollars to be distributed “according to individual need”, and suddenly the value system of a mother and her four children is seriously put to the test.

Born in Guangzhou, China, Lui Shou Kwan (1919–1975) is a renowned painter in the traditional and modern styles of Chinese ink painting.The scenery of the Pacific Northwest Coast forest remained an essential subject of Carr’s paintings, and similarly, Lui’s landscapes cannot be separated from the islands of Hong Kong. The exhibition presents more than forty works representing varied techniques and styles that each artist utilized to investigate the shapes, colours and rhythmic changes in nature.

In this suite of paintings the artist explores the paradoxical weight of light and lightness through the reactive materiality of mixed media.Evident in these latest works is the maturation of Watson's artistic process, as her panels reveal renewed confidence and technical mastery of her distinct painterly language. Watson’s works are endlessly evocative of organic forms, populated by familiar figures and rife with art historical reference— at once inviting subjective meaning whilst resisting easy interpretation and the stasis of representation.Watson's coalescing forms are suspended mid-motion and contain within them an expressive cacophony: marbled, multi-hued brushstrokes are juxtaposed against bold, gestural streaks to maintain precarious equilibrium. Stark ink lines inscribe the pictorial plane of Watson’s panels—disturbing profusions of calligraphic strokes and contrasted with sporadic rushes of pure colour. All punctuated by decisive pastel markings and unfolding on a gradient and richly hued surface, oft delineated by the dynamic introduction of a horizon line. Each piece is a deeply nuanced and profoundly personal undertaking, composed of singular moments of paint and informed by a great depth of feeling, manifested in the application of each individual element.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2585396,"lng":-123.1389564},"southwest":{"lat":49.2584563,"lng":-123.1394198}},"location":{"lat":49.258498,"lng":-123.1391881},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.25984693029149,"lng":-123.1378391197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2571489697085,"lng":-123.1405370802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"3045 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3J9, Canada"},{"id":"1016026","tags":["Other"],"name":"Yoga for Any Body","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/semperviva_georgiastraight_eventheaders_feb11_erin.jpg?itok=y23OU0Bi","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/semperviva_georgiastraight_eventheaders_feb11_erin.jpg?itok=oXifjRuy"],"endDate":"2018-02-11T15:30:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-11T13:30:00-08:00","description":"YOGA FOR ANY BODY: TAKE CARE OF YOUR BACKEver said “I can’t practice yoga because I’m not flexible”, “I just push through back pain to touch my toes”, or leave a yoga class feeling strain beyond normal muscle fatigue in your back?Breath, mindfulness and the postures of yoga are helpful in providing pain management and an active self-care regimen for your back!Learn how to practice in a regular public class with a focus on longevity, safety and good habitual patterns for back health!","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.268327,"lng":-123.1554636},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2696759802915,"lng":-123.1541146197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2669780197085,"lng":-123.1568125802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"2201 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC V6K 1N9, Canada"},{"id":"1019856","tags":["Theatre","Performing Arts"],"name":"Metamorphosis Butoh","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/show_images_750x3755.jpg?itok=vE8wU9XY","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/show_images_750x3755.jpg?itok=WExiVUuy"],"endDate":"2018-02-24T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-21T20:00:00-08:00","description":"Choreographed by Argentinian Artist Gustavo Collini-Sartor, Metamorphosis Butoh explores the spirit of death and rebirth, a recurring theme in the Japanese aesthetic of Butoh.

It’s an audio experience like no other: re-enactment, internal monologue, evocative aural textures and more.What does it mean for a mind to be injured?

She has produced text-based installations and printed matter that draw attention to the ways that governments obfuscate their accountability towards Indigenous rights and title in public address, policy and service. This series includes We Are Sorry (2008-10), Budget Cuts (2012), Cut and Muzzled (2014) and Taking Up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action (2016).In dialogue with these works, WE CALL is composed of selections from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s (TRC) 94 \"Calls to Action\". This document accompanies the 500-page report that synthesizes the TRC's inquiry into the inter-generational legacy of Canada's Indian Residential School System. Busby's selections highlight the ways that governmental, educational and cultural institutions are called on by the TRC to cultivate Indigenous leadership, stewardship and participation within structural systems. Through patterning and repetition, Busby's vivid floor-to-ceiling text painting makes these calls visible and persistent in the intellectual, social and bureaucratic life of SFU.The work's title, WE CALL, abbreviates the address of each call to action to emphasize the mutual responsibility of the caller(s) to participate in enacting these structural shifts. In the coming year, Busby will collaborate with SFU faculty and students from disciplines frequently addressed in the document to talk about how they can take up the TRC's calls to action through curriculum, critical dialogue and engaged learning.WE CALL at the Teck Gallery parallels Busby's collaboration with the Gitksan Wet'suwet'en Education Society in Hazelton, BC to produce an iteration of the wall text painting on their campus.Busby is a Canadian artist and activist based in Vancouver. Since the 1980s, her practice has addressed local political conditions and social structures as they express critical global issues. Busby was a Fulbright Scholar at New York University and holds a PhD in Communication from Concordia University. She is currently an Adjunct Professor of Visual Art at UBC.Curated by Amy Kazymerchyk","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2845417,"lng":-123.1116459},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28589068029149,"lng":-123.1102969197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2831927197085,"lng":-123.1129948802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"515 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada"},{"id":"1013526","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Frederic Rzewski’s Songs of Insurrection","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/daanvandewalle_280_280_1.jpg?itok=iLBFrVsI","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/daanvandewalle_280_280_1.jpg?itok=1JcYytWa"],"endDate":"2018-01-23T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-22T20:00:00-08:00","description":"Frederic Rzewski’s Songs of Insurrectionwith Daan Vandewalle, pianoMonday, January 22 &amp; Tuesday, January 23, 2018The Fox Cabaret2321 Main Street, VancouverBar opens at 7:00PM | Concert starts at 8:00PMGeneral Admission seating.

Her instruments are loop pedals, a drum machine and, of course, the cello: its melodies are plaintive but catchy, growing in number as the song progresses. These hooks repeat like echoes, part of a thick mixture yet distinct within it.Hailing from North Tallcree chiefs on her father’s side and Mennonite homesteaders on her mother’s, Derksen mixes styles like a painter mixes colours. Haunting, often mournful, yet somehow always celebratory, her music speaks to her mixed heritage and answers our multicultural needs.

Spanning more than seven decades, True Nordic reveals how Scandinavian design was introduced in Canada and how its aesthetics and material forms were adopted, revised and transformed. Featuring a wide array of furniture, textiles, ceramics, glass and metalwork, the exhibition offers a critical survey of Canadian design practices from the 1930s to the present.Canadians first became aware of Scandinavian design through travelling exhibitions, designer showrooms and articles and advertisements in popular magazines, but its significant influence on Canadian design and craft production can be attributed to the influx of immigrants from the region during the Depression and after the Second World War. These new Canadians—often trained in the craft traditions of their homeland—introduced local audiences to a modern and functional aesthetic that privileged natural materials, simplicity of shape and expressive imagery. Canadians, who share a similar climate, topography and democratic government with their Nordic counterparts, admired these pragmatic and rational objects devised for everyday use and began to emulate their material and formal qualities in goods created for the Canadian marketplace. The result was a new national design language that continues to influence artisans working today.Featuring more than 100 prototypes, designer originals and limited edition and mass-produced wares, True Nordic highlights the enduring legacy of Scandinavian design principles in Canada. Designers will include Niels Bendtsen, Bocci, Karen Bulow, Kjeld and Erica Deichmann, Thor Hansen, Andrew Jones, Janis Kravis, molo, Carl Poul Petersen, Rudolph Renzius and Marion Smith, among many others.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2830077,"lng":-123.1208179},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28435668029149,"lng":-123.1194689197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2816587197085,"lng":-123.1221668802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"750 Hornby St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 2H7, Canada"},{"id":"1016936","tags":["Literary/Books"],"name":"Room Magazine Launch: 40.4 &quot;Let&#039;s Make Contact&quot;","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/404cover.jpg?itok=3BjeRpYd","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/404cover.jpg?itok=zpRTvSq6"],"endDate":"2018-01-19T18:30:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-19T18:30:00-08:00","description":"Join Room Magazine for the launch of our winter 2017 issue, 40.4 \"Let's Make Contact.\"Readers:Chelsea Comeau is a freelance writer and editor whose work has appeared in CV2, Villamere, and Quills.

As they race to stop information about the sinister origins of Jack’s drug from getting out, they begin to form an uncommonly close bond that neither of them fully understand. And underlying it all is one fundamental question: Is freedom possible in a culture where everything, even people, can be owned?","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.26532,"lng":-123.1006618},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.26666898029149,"lng":-123.0993128197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.26397101970849,"lng":-123.1020107802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"2206 Main St, Vancouver, BC V5T 1J8, Canada"},{"id":"1015361","tags":["Galleries"],"name":"Marcia Pitch: About Face","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/face_12_copy.jpg?itok=RbEjrxt8","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/face_12_copy.jpg?itok=LBoon2ql"],"endDate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-10T00:00:00-08:00","description":"Marcia Pitch has been focused on the bizarre and disturbing throughout her artistic practice.

Through this lens, the disguise in the quotidian is revealed and acts to push our understanding of how truth and madness exist around us in our everyday lives. (text by Maeve Hanna)Marcia Pitch’s work has spanned four decades, including installation art, assemblage, and collage. Graduating in Fine Arts from the University of Manitoba in the late 60's she went on to do graduate work at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. Pitch had long been concerned with social issues, and while parenting she began her engagement with recycling the materials around her into art -- then toys and household objects. While continuing to draw on everyday materials, Pitch’s more recent work in collage evokes body politics, genetic manipulation, and imagines a drastically accelerated pace of evolution shaped by pollution and climate change.image credit : Marcia Pitch, face#12, collage on paper, 11\" x 15\", 2017This exhibition is on display at City Hall Galleria located at Richmond City Hall, 6911 No. 3 Road.

In 2015 AVIATOR SHADES pulled off their first cross Canada tour, highlighted by a showcase at Canadian Music Week in Toronto; and completed 2 regional tours, all the while winning over new audiences and supporting the likes of HALESTORM ,APRIL WINE, MONSTER TRUCK, JUDAS PRIEST, WHITESNAKE, DANKO JONES, ECONOLINE CRUSH , THE ODDS, THE LAZYS , and many more.Their 2014 release “ Ready To Blow ” was produced by Danny Craig (One Bad Son, Default) and showcases a modern take on no nonsense classic hard rock in the spirit of Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple and UFO. Ready to Blow spawned the band’s first single, “Who Do You Think You Are” which was released to radio in 2015 and garnered adds across multiple Canadian provinces, eventually charting at #42 on Canadian Active Rock.The lifeblood of the band is Irish born Singer/Songwriter Dave Gorman , different incarnations of AVIATOR SHADES had been gigging around Dublin and Vancouver, with the essential lineup finally taking shape in 2013. Now including guitarists Daniel James and George Baker equally gifted lead players who complement each other’s playing magically! and drummer Spencer Tomlinson , whose thunderous drumming blends perfectly with Gorman’s grooving bass lines. Hot on the heels of their triumphant 2015, AVIATOR SHADES began 2016 working on new material, and are slated to hit the recording studio, where long time collaborator and producer Danny Craig will share production duties with the legendary Mike Fraser (AC/DC, Aerosmith). This will take the band in 2017 at new level and they will be ready to take on the National Canadian music scene.Tokyo Bleu (Vancouver) //Tokyo Bleu is a Japanese band formed in Vancouver in 2014. Currently, members are Aki (guitar/vocals/programming), Yuki (drums).The sound style is based by ambient and industrial rock. They've recorded first demo at Fader Mountain Sound in 2015 and they are the first Japanese band that recorded in Vancouver.Nine O'Clock Gun (Vancouver) // http://www.nineoclockgun.ca/In the waning notes of 2012, High School friends Chuck Konopski (Bass) and brothers Rick (Guitar) and Brandon (Drums) Corness set out to find a frontman to complete their lineup. Their search led them to Corey Fenton, former guitarist of the now defunct rock group “The Stone Pines” (https://thestonepines.bandcamp.com/). Not known on stage for his singing, Fenton had second thoughts about joining. However, the trio heard something special in the distorted vocal tracks of Corey’s demos and convinced him to give it a try.The newly form band quickly began song-writing and finding the distinctive sound which would lay the foundation for their first EP released one year later (January 9th 2014), the night of their first show.Recorded at Harbourside Studios in North Vancouver with producer Mike Slater (Slow Wave Saga),the self-titled 6 song EP did well earning a spot as the lead track on UK-based Classic Rock Magazine’s indie compilation, \"By Royal Appointment\", distributed in issue 195.Shortly after the release, Chuck announced his approaching departure from the group in order to pursue career opportunities in Toronto. One of his final shows with the band, a howler at the now defunct Electric Owl in Vancouver, featured local musical heavyweights “Grizzly Bones” and a mysterious acoustic set by former “The Coalition” frontman William John. Totally blown away by his performance, Corey recruited Will to be the lead guitarist for the reboot of the “The Stone Pines”. Although the project never did get off the ground, it did lead to Will’s assimilation into “Nine O’Clock Gun” as the new bassist and eventual lead guitarist when former Stone Pines bassist, Clark Buchanan, was asked to join.The new quintet quickly gelled and set to work finishing off their follow up EP, STORMS, which had been put on hold following Chuck’s departure.

McDonald's sharp text and stealthy choreography paint a rich, immersive portrait of a beatnik's bold dissatisfaction and biting social commentary: the result is a soundscape of words and beats that offers timely modern parallels.Do NOT miss the show that won both the Cultchivating the Fringe Award AND the Georgia Straight Critics' Pick (Fun fact: Jayson McDonald has won this award 3 times...!) at the Vancouver Fringe in 2012.\"McDonald uses the crass and the crude to reflect the crassness of society and its construction of politics, religion and the American Dream. The profane moments are quite often peppered with moments of extreme craft and wit. McDonald’s version of Burroughs is always questioning what is a hallucination, what is a vision and what is reality\" (Onstage Ottawa).Way Off-Broadway Wednesday serves up fresh theatre from the fringes in a casual cabaret setting - EVERY Hump Day.

The emphasis here is on rhythm—you’ll struggle to stay in your seat as the propulsive beats roll and the dancers move in finely controlled harmony.Gravel bridges the mainstream and the esoteric in a delightful blend. With the music as with the dance, this is Gravel’s signature crossbreeding at its finest—a heady mash-up of styles, moulded for maximum kinetic power. The musical references— rock, R&amp;B, even classical—seem stranger, more radical, more alive in combination with the others.

Too often, emotional uplift and political subversion walk separate paths in the arts; but in these days of resurgent authoritarianism, the impulses need to be united. On that score, Rzewski’s composition is perfect: it lifts the spirit without letting it off the hook.Protest songs from around the world are gathered together, as if at one large rally. They include “Soldiers of the Moor,” written by concentration camp inmates, and the beautiful American civil rights anthem “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.” Rzewski and Vandewalle take these works as points of departure, transforming them without for a moment betraying their moral or historical meaning. Beneath the eclecticism, the improvisation and the avant-garde elements remains the core, grounding impulse of each of these works: to drive the struggle of the powerless against the powerful."},{"id":"1018151","tags":["Film"],"name":"The Great Buddha+","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/greatbuddha_180111.jpg?itok=t1g-oR5T","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/greatbuddha_180111.jpg?itok=xB32BE-w"],"endDate":"2018-02-01T19:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-26T14:50:00-08:00","description":"In Huang Hsin-Yao's debut feature, a couple of working men come across some compromising dashcam footage of a corrupt businessman.

Avasilichioaei’s practice is concerned with textuality, polylingual poetics, the social and political forces/voices of the polis, and the intermediary spaces between word, sound and image, exploring the transgressions of these terrains through poetry, translation, performance, and sound work.During her time in Vancouver, Avasilichioaei will do a public talk and multimedia performance, as well as visit interdisciplinary, graduate and undergraduate art classes and facilitate a workshop. In conjunction with faculty member Allyson Clay, Avasilichioaei will work with third-year visual art students towards conceptualizing and creating work for the annual student exhibition in the Audain Gallery. Conceived as a laboratory of research and making, her intervention will focus on unpacking various notions of border—border as wall, border as place, border in translation—proposing some theoretical and aesthetic reflections on its reverberations. Given current polylingual contexts, migration and displacement, wall-building and global-village thinking, various boundary disputes around the world, and the increasingly hazy distinction between private and public, this is a crucial moment to consider how one conceptualizes national, physical and personal boundaries, in order to discover whether productive crossovers are possible, as opposed to more rigid and entrenched responses. Some questions worth considering include: How do we enact borders? How do we translate them? What are the ethical implications of this translation? Is a language a border? By encouraging various translations/transpositions between text and performance, image and sound, text and image, the organic and the technological, materiality and musicality, etc., the lab will investigate the border as a potential in-between, porous space; disputed, yet also productive.As part of her residency, Avasilichioaei will present LIMBS &amp; THRESHOLDS, an immersive multimedia performance of poetic texts, involving layered voices and live vocal play, sampled sounds, effects pedals and electronics, a theremin, and textured projections of poems and images (created in collaboration with Jessie Altura). In a world where the political, linguistic and bodily border is a place of strife and violence, LIMBS &amp; THRESHOLDS explores ways of rethinking the border by breaking down the boundaries between word and sound, sense and resonance, original and translation, image and reflection. Based on Avasilichioaei’s hybrid book Limbinal (Talonbooks 2015) as well as current project Eight Track, the performance presents a series of phonotopes, in-between places of sound and figure, orchestral and in flux, generative and inhabited.BioOana Avasilichioaei’s five poetry collections include feria: a poempark (2008; a poetic investigation of the fractured historicities of Vancouver’s Hastings Park), We, Beasts (2012, awarded the A. M. Klein Prize for Poetry; a textual architecture of orality, animality and the fairytale) and Limbinal (2015; a multi-genre polylingual work on notions of borders). Increasingly interstitial, her work has also gone outside the bounds of the book, encompassing various formats such as multimedia performance, sound work, photography, graphic score, and installation; recent multimedia performances include THRESHOLDS (2015) and MOUTHNOTES (2016). Also a translator of prose and poetry from French and Romanian, her most recent translation is Bertrand Laverdure’s Readopolis (2017 Governor General Literary Award for Translation). Avasilichioaei has performed her work and given talks in festivals, art spaces, universities, theatres and other venues in Canada, USA, Mexico and Europe and was the 2009 Writer in Residence at Green College, UBC and the 2010–2011 Writer in Residence at the University of Calgary. Her curatorial and collaborative work has taken numerous forms, such as founding and curating the Atwater Poetry Project (2004–2009), writing “Folding Borders: Experimenting in the Canadian Laboratory” (series of commentaries on Jacket2, 2011), and co-writing Expeditions of a Chimæra with Erín Moure (2009).

In the context of an expanded view on the subject, Living, Building, Thinking offers a rich and thought-provoking perspective on the relationships between artists and societies, and the ever-changing responses and visual expressions that circulate through shared hopes and aspirations for social awareness and change.Living, Building, Thinking is comprised of more than 90 works in all mediums, including examples of European art from the 16th to early 20th centuries by William Blake, Paul Gauguin and Edvard Munch. Also highlighted are striking works from the German Expressionist and Weimar period, as well as mid-to-late 20th century European paintings by artists like Jörg Immendorf, Anslem Kiefer and Sigmar Polke. Canadian contemporary works by artists such as Barbara Astman, Betty Goodwin, Natalka Husar, Nancy Johnson, Gary Pearson, Leopold Plotek and Tony Scherman demonstrate the lasting legacies of Expressionism.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2830077,"lng":-123.1208179},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28435668029149,"lng":-123.1194689197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2816587197085,"lng":-123.1221668802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"750 Hornby St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 2H7, Canada"},{"id":"1015856","tags":["Museums"],"name":"Beachy Terrarium Workshop","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/beachy_terrarium_workshop_winter_2018_header.jpg?itok=BLuQgOtr","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/beachy_terrarium_workshop_winter_2018_header.jpg?itok=VaPdtbIE"],"endDate":"2018-04-07T16:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-01-27T14:00:00-08:00","description":"Bring the tranquility of the beach back home by creating your own beachy terrarium at the Maritime Museum of British Columbia!

The exhibition investigates digital technology’s influence on contemporary print-making. Each artist engages the challenges and opportunities digital methods present to the function and process of the medium and its contribution to the conceptual construction of artworks. Underlying the works is the notion of image transfer as well as the transference of meaning supported and sometimes led by new digital innovations.The artists’ works represent a diversity of experimentation and exploration; each has researched and employed various print-based practices as a vehicle for examining the diverse personal and cultural histories that their subject matter references. With their point of departure being a traditional print practice, the artists have transferred in parallel both the conceptual and technical matrix resulting in work that is both a separation from and a repetition of its source material and point of origin.The opening will be Saturday, January 27 at 7:30pm and a Panel Discussion with artists Aimée Henny Brown, Saskia Jetten, Ross Kelly, Colin Lyons , moderated by guest curator Hannamari Jalovaara will be held just prior to the reception at 6:15pm.Image credit; Ross Kelly, \"Illuminated Manuscript #2\", 2017","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.163814,"lng":-123.1409957},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.16516298029149,"lng":-123.1396467197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.16246501970849,"lng":-123.1423446802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"7700 Minoru Gate, Richmond, BC V6Y 1R9, Canada"},{"id":"1014001","tags":[],"name":"Harpdog Brown","endDate":"2018-01-18T00:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-18T00:00:00-08:00","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.275115,"lng":-123.099599},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2764639802915,"lng":-123.0982500197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2737660197085,"lng":-123.1009479802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1038 Main St, Vancouver, BC V6A 2W1, Canada"},{"id":"1013456","tags":["Dance"],"name":"Everybody Dance Free Community Dance Workshops","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/2018_01_14_every_body_dance_workshops_jpg.jpg?itok=t9WL2iXQ","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/2018_01_14_every_body_dance_workshops_jpg.jpg?itok=gz4q5OdR"],"endDate":"2018-01-14T14:15:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-14T11:00:00-08:00","description":"An offering of 3 different community dance workshops.Community dance is about people like you and me working with professional dance artists, connecting to dance experiences that we can own, helping us achieve a sense of belonging, and positively impacting our experience of being in a community.11:00am-11:45am: Dancing the Parenting / Foolish Operations Ensemble (0-5yrs children and parents/caregivers).Registration link: https://ca.apm.activecommunities.com/vancouver/Activity_Search/everybody-dance-foolish-operations-ensemble/14822812:00-12:45pm: Jacky Essombé(all ages and families welcomed)Registration link: https://ca.apm.activecommunities.com/vancouver/Activity_Search/every-body-dance-jacky-essombe-and-guests/1482311:30-2:15pm: Desirée Dunbar (55yrs+)Registration link: https://ca.apm.activecommunities.com/vancouver/Activity_Search/every-body-dance-desiree-dunbar/148232","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2733084,"lng":-123.1217472},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2746573802915,"lng":-123.1203982197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2719594197085,"lng":-123.1230961802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"181 Roundhouse Mews, Vancouver, BC V6Z 2W3, Canada"},{"id":"1017666","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Reassembled, Slightly Askew | Shannon Yee (Northern Ireland)","description":"An audacious melding of art and science, this multidisciplinary adventure is a head-trip in the literal sense.

The work of gender theorist Judith Butler looms large, as do the twin legacies of rock ‘n’ roll and DJ music.

Trans filmmaker and musician Clyde Petersen presents his animated film Torrey Pines with a live score by Lori Goldston, Zach Burba, Jacob Jaffe and his own bad self. Featuring dumpster dives, a schizophrenic mother, a cross-country car odyssey and more, it’s a movie memoir like no other—as innovative and idiosyncratic as they come.Telling the story of his misgendered pre-teen years in SoCal and elsewhere across the States, Petersen uses stop-motion technique to brilliant effect. Coloured-in cutouts depict the landscape of early-90s America, and the director adds wonderfully vivid details: tigers come out of angry mouths, milk jets out of breasts and cigarette smoke rings take on the darkest shade of black.

There’s a story she wants to tell, of an encounter she once had in a foreign country. Walking by a canal one day, she saw a man throwing stones at a duck and wound up in a nasty confrontation with him. The experience stayed with her, and grew into an idea for a show about morality, culture and the politics of intervention.A furious thinker and a born entertainer, Gunn leaps and poses onstage while firing off anecdotes, philosophical asides and more. Movement and monologue are the tools here, employed to galvanizing effect. This performer can shake up an audience with the best of them—her work has the verbal density of a great podcast, but it’s a live, physical experience if there ever was one to be had."},{"id":"1018131","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"The Walkers | Director: Singing Chen (Taiwan)","description":"Dance choreographer Lin Lee-Chen creates brilliant works of movement and colour; in this documentary portrait, director Singing Chen presents a style to match her subject.

In this soul-searching work, the presence of the choir represents the most beautiful aspects of our shared humanity.Pi draws on community choirs from the Metro Vancouver area for participation; each performance, a different choral group shares the stage with the show’s two actors.

Participants arrive at a location with a wide city vista. There, they listen to recordings from local children speaking as their older selves. The kids describe the future as they imagine it; they then arrive to talk with their listener in person. The cycle repeats itself, with the speakers casting further into the future each time. In the end, listeners are left alone to gaze and contemplate.What will happen to Vancouver? What does the future hold for our youth? These questions have taken on a particular urgency in our time of rampant construction and looming environmental crisis.

With guitar and banjo in hand, she has spent years chronicling the rural and urban life paths of Canada, writing songs to tell the tales of the hard-hit, hard-won victories of these everymen and women. This is new music that is relevant to a modern audience but rooted in the musical traditions that grew out of communities where there was little separation between performer and audience - where everyone played something, or danced - and where music was clearly connected to the everyday lives of the people who played it.The Annie Lou touring ensemble includes Canadian acoustic champs Andrew Collins, Max Heineman (both from Toronto's Foggy Hogtown Boys), and Sarah Hamilton – a tight instrumental and vocal unit that offers superb musicianship and an infectious delight in their craft. In live performance the band gallops along with joyful danceable precision, enticing audiences with twin fiddles, banjo, three and four part harmonies, call and response, and compelling instrumental solos.Advance tickets available at roguefolk.bc.ca, Highlife Records, and Tapestry Music Vancouver.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2630426,"lng":-123.176235},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2643915802915,"lng":-123.1748860197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2616936197085,"lng":-123.1775839802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"3214 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V6K 2L2, Canada"},{"id":"1003491","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Santana","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/12/santana_171204.jpg?itok=b6PstEyu","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/12/santana_171204.jpg?itok=ReuQQwkS"],"endDate":"2018-03-07T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-03-07T20:00:00-08:00","description":"American Latin-rock band, known for such hits as \"Black Magic Woman\" and \"Smooth\", performs on its Divination Tour 2018.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.0304317,"lng":-122.2871315},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.0317806802915,"lng":-122.2857825197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.02908271970851,"lng":-122.2884804802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"33800 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC V2S 8H8, Canada"},{"id":"1018251","tags":["Performing Arts"],"name":"Spectralism","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/paoandhille1_bysamanshariati_1200x800.jpg?itok=j1flV3zd","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/paoandhille1_bysamanshariati_1200x800.jpg?itok=x3wfEZa8"],"endDate":"2018-02-24T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-24T20:00:00-08:00","description":"Through musical explorations of sonic textures and gestures, spectralism embodies a fascinating and exceptionally resonating sound world.

So they end up polluting when they could in fact become resourceful.We’ll explore its biology - how they can be a good indicator of health or disease; with a side trip to microbiome concepts, fecal transplants, etc.What is wrong with our current methods of handling waste, poop, from the bad design of toilets and washrooms, all the way to how current sewage practices pollutes our environment: excess nutrients in our water; fecal coliforms on our beaches, parasites like crypto and toxo in our drinking waters; pharmaceuticals and drugs confusing our fish; plastics in the ocean and our salmon steaks; fatbergs and “flushable” towels plug our sewers.The take-away: we are a wasteful society. That needs to stop, for our sake and for the planet’s sake, and the first step is to a solution is a realistic dialog.The KPU-Science World Speaker Series is a partnership developed between KPU and Science World that supports the expansion of science in our communities.

Located in the beautiful lakeside woodlands of Bethlehem Centre at Mt. Benson in Nanaimo, BC on gorgeous Vancouver Island, Bethlehem Centre is offering a tranquil experience of ancient knowledge and secrets of renewal and rest.Join us from Friday, March 2nd to Sunday, March 4th, 2018 at 2371 Arbot Rd. as we explore an ancient spiritual technique of staying healthy, balanced, and positive: Shabbat (Sabbath), the weekly day of rest. Shabbat is both practical and spiritual, part ancient labour legislation, part celebration of creation.Shabbat will be led by Rabbi Laura Duhan-Kaplan and her husband Charles Kaplan, musician and psychologist. Duhan-Kaplan is the Vancouver School of Theology’s Director of inter-religious studies. Laura is a Rabbi, writer, researcher and an award-winning educator and religious leader. She has received many teaching awards, including the Carnegie Foundation’s prestigious U.S. Professor of the Year Award.The Shabbat experience allows for a chance at spiritual reflection and provides the time for spending special worship devotion in meditation and sharing time with loved ones. Immerse yourself in the rhythm of the Jewish Shabbat experience for a 25-hour traditional exploration of rejuvenation. We will enjoy Shabbat rituals, explore themes of gratitude and wonder from Shabbat liturgy, study Biblical and Kabbalistic interpretations and discuss, sing, study and relax. This transformational, peaceful experience will allow you to take the needed time to honour yourself and the divine.For more information email Johanne Nicholson at info@bethlehemcentre.com or telephone us at 250.754.3254.

Ivan is a seasoned stage performer and long-time road dog, and over the last twenty years has become an audience favourite at storytelling, writer’s, film, poetry, and folk music festivals from Anchorage to Amsterdam. Ivan often grapples with the complex and intensely personal issues of gender identity in their work, as well as topics such as family, class, social justice and queer liberation, but always with a generous heart, a quick wit, and the nuanced and finely-honed timing of a gifted raconteur. Ivan’s stories remind of us of our own fallible and imperfect humanity while at the same time inspiring us to change the world.Tegan Quin is a musician and half of the Canadian indie pop band, Tegan and Sara. Tegan and Sara have sold more than one million albums, and have received seven Gold certifications, one Double Platinum certification, three Juno Awards, two Polaris Prize nominations, and a Grammy nomination. They have performed on some of the world’s biggest stages, from the 2015 Oscar Telecast to major festivals such as Coachella, Lollapalooza and Glastonbury. Tegan has openly identified as queer since the beginning of her career in 1998, and has been an outspoken feminist advocate for LGBTQ equality and gender justice. Tegan is a board member of the Girls Rock Camp Foundation and have supported several LGBTQ organizations over the past two decades. The Tegan And Sara Foundation is an extension of Tegan and Sara's work, identity and longstanding commitment to supporting and building progressive social change.Find out more about the work of our partners &amp; join the online discussion in SFU's Vancity Office of Community Engagement Facebook group!","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2823717,"lng":-123.1085803},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28372068029149,"lng":-123.1072313197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2810227197085,"lng":-123.1099292802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"149 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B, Canada"},{"id":"1019006","tags":["Food & Drink","Other"],"name":"Cancer-Proof Your Body","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/eventbrite_cover.png?itok=RApJwUGP","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/eventbrite_cover.png?itok=qJSEkvws"],"endDate":"2018-04-19T20:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-03-29T18:00:00-07:00","description":"Your dietary habits have a tremendous impact on your chances of recovering from cancer and preventing it in the first place.

To make the critical experience of it is to put it to the test, in its theories and practices. In what way do the criticisms addressed to cultural mediation allow it to push its limits? Can its values and repertoires of action help transform social relationships?Nathalie Casemajor is a co-editor of Expériences critiques de la médiation culturelle. This book proposes to re-evaluate the anchors of cultural mediation in the face of recent transformations of society, culture and capitalism. It brings together contributions from Quebecois and European researchers who question its institutional foundations, its praxis and its discourses. If there is no consensus around the definition of cultural mediation, the tensions that animate it make it possible to rethink socio-cultural intervention today.Speaker BioNathalie Casemajor is an Assistant Professor in the Urbanisation Culture Société Research Centre at INRS (Institut national de la recherche scientifique, Montreal). Her work focuses on cultural development and digital culture. She is the coordinator of the Observatory of Cultural Mediations and coedited the book Expériences critiques de la médiation culturelle (PUL, 2017). She also conducted research projects on cultural institutions and Wikipedia, arts and public space and the circulation of news and artworks on the Web.Find out more about the work of our partners &amp; join the online discussion in SFU's Vancity Office of Community Engagement Facebook group!","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2823717,"lng":-123.1085803},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28372068029149,"lng":-123.1072313197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2810227197085,"lng":-123.1099292802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"149 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B, Canada"},{"id":"1019771","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Rainbow Kitten Surprise","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/rainbow.jpg?itok=YVrdHUYl","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/rainbow.jpg?itok=bk6TkE02"],"endDate":"2018-05-04T21:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-05-04T21:00:00-07:00","description":"American rockers perform tunes from new albumHow to: Friend, Love, Freefall.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.281962,"lng":-123.0998865},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2833109802915,"lng":-123.0985375197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2806130197085,"lng":-123.1012354802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"319 Main St, Vancouver, BC V6A 2T7, Canada"},{"id":"1021611","tags":["Forums & Talks"],"name":"Making Better Habits","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/meditatin_hands_small.jpg?itok=itBdDwDh","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/meditatin_hands_small.jpg?itok=fF4dSGqB"],"endDate":"2018-02-04T11:15:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-28T10:00:00-08:00","description":"Our weekly drop-in meditation &amp; buddhism classes have a different topic every week so you can always keep learning.

One night, a poor experience at a restaurant forces them to come back to their dingy abode earlier than expected. A casual evening of sex, pot, and talk turns into a casual night of drinking, arguing and reminiscing about the past, until unexpected guests arrive at their door and disrupt their stable existence, forcing them to re-examine themselves in the face of an unknown future.Written and directed by Midtwenties Theatre Society’s Beau Han Bridge, Above the Hospital features performances by Tristan Smith (Posh) as Cameron, Zack Currie (This Is Our Youth) as Bo, Nadya Debogorski (A Game of You) as Abbey, Aaron Paul Stewart (The Flick) as Michael and debut performances from emerging artists Mira Maschmeyer as Lauren, and Emma Young as Natasha. Above the Hospital is Beau’s first original theatre production.“I am beyond excited to debut this first-ever world premiere of Above the Hospital for Midtwenties Theatre Society”, says Beau Han Bridge, who has penned and directed the production. “Being a non-profit with the intention of creating theatre about millennials and coming-of-age themes, this original piece serves as a perfect chronicle of thoughts and societal challenges that one faces under the guise of no direction. There comes a time in your mid-twenties when the roads become nonlinear and one must make a decision as to where to go, forcing us to look back on our mistakes and plan out a future in a world that is beyond our control – the conflict that arises from this moment in time is where the drama is born, and what will be presented to audiences.”TICKETS: $20; available online at www.mtstheatre.com","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2724251,"lng":-123.1347074},"southwest":{"lat":49.2721027,"lng":-123.1352349}},"location":{"lat":49.2722639,"lng":-123.1349712},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.27361288029149,"lng":-123.1336221697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2709149197085,"lng":-123.1363201302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1601 Johnston St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3R9, Canada"},{"id":"1021926","tags":["Kids' Stuff"],"name":"Gamemaking and Circuitry with Scratch &amp; Makey Makey for Kids 9-12","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/clc_hive_logo_4.png?itok=8kJCGbR4","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/clc_hive_logo_4.png?itok=h350XpDY"],"endDate":"2018-02-04T16:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-04T13:00:00-08:00","description":"This workshop is for girls ages 9-12.

This exhibit encompasses over 50 Arctic oil paintings and 3 films from Trepanier’s 4 Arctic expeditions to the furthest reaches of the Canadian North. Its wilderness is so remote and untouched that many of its landscapes have never been documented before. Due to its extensive scope, the VMM has partnered with Vancouver Civic Theatres for an additional exhibit location at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre.The artist, Cory Trépanier, is a fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, and was named one of Canada’s Top 100 Living Explorers by Canadian Geographic magazine in 2015. He is also a member of the Explorers Club of Canada, and was recently honoured with its highest award, the 2015 Stefansson Medal.“Exploring and painting the Arctic intimately - by hiking, canoeing, camping, traveling with the Inuit - all this prepares me to experience nature’s wonder on a visceral and emotional level. Through this approach, I experience firsthand the awe and overwhelming sense of humility that is brought on from the realization of how tiny I am in these expansive landscapes.” C.

Travel back in time 9,000 years to China, where orange peel was found in the first fermented alcoholic beverage, and return to today, where mandarin orange peel remains one of China’s top selling herbs that promotes digestion. Now meet Tait Laboratories Inc., a company that was founded based on one chemistry Ph.D. student’s idea, that mandarin orange peel has the potential to reverse incurable neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis. You will learn about the company’s journey through a scientific lens, from its early days to the present, having developed a mandarin orange peel product sold across Canada in over 1,000 stores including 400 Rexall pharmacies. You will leave with a basic understanding of how herbal products like the company’s mandarin orange peel-based product are developed and brought to market in Canada, and about the science that is required to substantiate health claims on this and other exciting new botanical products.Dr. Andrew Tait is the founder of Tait Laboratories Inc., a company devoted to developing natural medicines from agricultural bi-products. After a B.Sc. in Biochemistry and M.Sc. in Chemistry from Concordia University (Montreal), he completed a Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of British Columbia.Inspired by his thesis work on multiple sclerosis, he subsequently identified Traditional Chinese Medicines as having potential to treat a wide range of chronic diseases; he founded the company while finishing his graduate studies.In 2012, he was invited to Ottawa to be awarded the NSERC Innovation Challenge Award, for successfully translating his Ph.D. research to an entrepreneurial venture. In 2014, he was awarded the BC Food Processors Association “Rising Star” award.Dr. Tait is a regularly invited speaker on the topics of entrepreneurship and the science supporting natural health products; he was keynote speaker in 2012 at the Annual Symposium of the Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine (Vancouver) and in 2016 at the Functional Foods and Natural Health Products Graduate Research Symposium (Winnipeg).Supported by the Futurpreneur Canada, the Bank of Development of Canada, the UBC’s Entrepreneurship@UBC program, and the NSERC and NRC Industry Research Assistance Program (IRAP), he works with industrial and academic researchers developing safe, affordable, and clinically proven medicines. He successfully launched MS+ Mandarin Skin PlusÒ, a patent-pending digestive product now on shelf in over 1000 pharmacies and health food stores across Canada, including 400 Rexall pharmacies.Dr. Tait mentors young companies as an Entrepreneur in Residence at both SFU Coast Capital Savings Venture Connection and also the Health Tech Innovation Hub and he also volunteers his time to mentor students of the Student Biotechnology Network.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.28317639999999,"lng":-123.1122509},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28452538029149,"lng":-123.1109019197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.28182741970849,"lng":-123.1135998802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"433 W Pender St, Vancouver, BC V6B 1V2, Canada"},{"id":"1025271","tags":["Festivals","Holiday"],"name":"Year of the Dog Temple Fair","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/2018cny.jpg?itok=p4WxBc-P","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/2018cny.jpg?itok=6tC8aj6f"],"endDate":"2018-02-18T16:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-18T10:00:00-08:00","description":"The Year of the Dog Temple Fair celebration is filled with barks of joy.

His performance and moving image works engage almost masochistic levels of endurance, often focusing on themes of sexuality, humanity, and the body. Takamine received his degree from Kyoto City University of Arts and Music’s Craft Division. He later studied at the International Academy of Media-Arts and Sciences (IAMAS) in Gifu, Japan. He is a frequent collaborator with dancers and other performance and media artists, including the influential Japanese multimedia-performance group Dumb Type, which he was an active member of from 1992 to 1997. He has been an artist-in-residence at the Jerusalem Center for the Visual Arts, Banff Center for the Arts, Saw Video Centre for the Media Arts, Ottawa, and the Yokohama Museum of Art, which culminated in a solo exhibition entitled Too Far To See (2011). He has exhibited extensively throughout Asia, North America, and Europe, including as part of the 2003 Venice Biennale, the 2004 Busan Biennale, the 2005 Yokohama Triennial, and the 2010 Aichi Triennial, as well as exhibited in Australia, Israel, Mexico, and South Africa.Presented by the SFU School for the Contemporary Arts and the Audain Visual Artist in Residence Program.Image: Tadasu Takamine, God Bless America (detail), 2002, video still.

With art as a reflective space, the depth of human experience emerges in colour, light and shadow, in form and in feeling. This process of self-perception and self-reflection leading to transformation is the fire needed to challenge injustice and inequity, to listen intently to the stories others have to tell, to know exactly when and how to take action, to disrupt, to effect change. On Instinct is a chance to invoke potential for healing and resolution of the past, as well as openness to new experience and individual strength in the journey forward.Alicia Marie Lawrence is an urban contemporary artist working in 2-dimensional and digital mediums, and a practicing creative writer and graphic designer.

The work illuminates Canada’s role in the liberation of the Netherlands. Even today, Canada is fondly remembered by the Dutch, as liberators, who in 1945 rescued millions from distress and starvation. Curators, Laura Lee Coles and Gayle O’Hara recognized that Van Kijkduinstraat resonates a “defining moment” in Canada’s military history and engages viewers by way of its multi-layered expressiveness. It is a poignant national and local human-interest story and it was chosen to be the museum’s inaugural public art exhibition funded by Vancouver Cultural Services.Since immigrating to Canada, Dirk shared glimpses of the story of his escape to the family over the years. In 2016, Irwin and Inessa (father/daughter) traveled back to the Netherlands where they set out to retrace Dirk's escape route and to discover for themselves their intertwined Dutch/Canadian connections of this deeply emotional story. From the vivid experiences in the landscape of the North Netherlands, they stopped in many of the places Dirk had sought refuge. From their film, photo and sound documentation the artists combine the media to create a multi-channel visual installation.Van Kijkduinstraat is a local, national and emotional personal story that also comments on a historic moment for Canada’s military. This installation includes audio interviews with Mark Zuehlke (Canada’s foremost WW2 historian and Recipient of the 2014 Governor General's History Award for Popular Media Author of the Canadian Battle Series), as well as commentary from Dutch journalists and photographers met along the journey.Designed as a progression of multiple parts, the exhibition will capture the viewer as the visuals shift as a multi-screened choreographic visual and sound symphony as if moving in temporal waves. This event is made possible through the generous support of Vancouver Cultural Services Public Art Grant, William F. White, International, IMAPON, with assistance from the Consulate General of the Netherlands in Vancouver, the Commemorative Partnership Program of Veteran Affairs Canada, and Templeton Secondary School.See: www.vankijkduinstraat.nl #vankijkduinstraat for further details.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2732532,"lng":-123.1517905},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2746021802915,"lng":-123.1504415197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2719042197085,"lng":-123.1531394802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1407 Laburnum St, Vancouver, BC V6J 3W4, Canada"},{"id":"1021791","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Beethoven Sonatas Recital","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/latest-beethoven-sonatas-recital-recovered-page-001.jpg?itok=yn_pKdJn","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/latest-beethoven-sonatas-recital-recovered-page-001.jpg?itok=hZs21WaM"],"endDate":"2018-01-28T21:10:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-28T19:00:00-08:00","description":"In the recital, there are five very excellent youth pianists: Ryan Zhu, Kitty Liu, Maggie Lu, Micheal Lu and Spencer Tsai to perform Beethoven's  different piano sonatas such as \"Moonlight\", \"Pathetique\", \"Waldstein\" and so on.

Central to the exhibition, Rereading Room is a reconstruction of the Vancouver Women’s Bookstore (1973-1996) in the second iteration of a project by Alexandra Bischoff. Thirteen artists, writers, theorists and researchers have been invited to occupy the installation as The Readers for the duration of the exhibition, working with and against the inventory by reading, annotating and supplementing the collection to form a dossier of responses. A textile multiple by Kathy Slade will wrap and adorn The Readers and lingering visitors. Lisa Robertson finds in Baudelaire’s dandy a tangible presence for old women in public spaces. A multitude of artworks dating from 1968 to 2017 explore language as a medium and material including works by Allyson Clay, Judith Copithorne, Gathie Falk, Jamelie Hassan, Germaine Koh, Laiwan, Sara Leydon, Divya Mehra, Adrian Piper, Kristina Lee Podesva, Anne Ramsden, Evelyn Roth and Elizabeth Zvonar, among others, that are drawn from the Belkin Art Gallery collection, the Kamloops Art Gallery, SFU Galleries, the Surrey Art Gallery and the Vancouver Art Gallery.Credit: Divya Mehra, The Bitch Blues (where does the Divide begin?), 2014.

These are songs and tunes for life and all of its occasions: festivals, dances, wars, parties and funerals. The music comes from a tradition that has inspired and brought together generations of people. Its themes – love, loss, hard work and hardship, faith, and everyday life – speak to everyone.

Fearing has released ten albums as a solo artist, featuring musical guests including: Bruce Cockburn, Margo Timmons, Richard Thompson, Shawn Colvin, Sarah McLachlan, and Suzie Vinnick. As co-founder of Blackie and the Rodeo Kings he has released nine albums, and two albums as half of the duo Fearing &amp; White. Like the guests on his albums, the many awards and nominations that have come his way over the years speak to the respect he has earned among his peers, presenters, and critics. With a life of many relocations and countless months on the road performing, Fearing is a gifted storyteller and true musical nomad with the ability to captivate audiences of all sizes and attitudes. “Getting on stage is the fun part, especially when the adrenaline kicks in,” he says, with a broad smile. “People want to relax and be taken on a journey. I sketch out my shows so they deliver on that.”Advance tickets available at roguefolk.bc.ca, as well as at Highlife Records &amp; Tapestry Music Vancouver.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2630426,"lng":-123.176235},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2643915802915,"lng":-123.1748860197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2616936197085,"lng":-123.1775839802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"3214 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V6K 2L2, Canada"},{"id":"987956","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"The Dears","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/10/thedears_171030.jpg?itok=ThctpXbM","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/10/thedears_171030.jpg?itok=o1v7lBsS"],"endDate":"2018-03-09T19:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-03-09T19:00:00-08:00","description":"Montréal indie-rock band tours in support of seventh studio albumTimes Infinity Volume Two.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.26425889999999,"lng":-123.1011823},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.26560788029149,"lng":-123.0998333197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.26290991970849,"lng":-123.1025312802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"2321 Main St, Vancouver, BC V5T 3C9, Canada"},{"id":"1022911","tags":["Attractions"],"name":"Mystic Poet Pairing: Hafiz and Rumi","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/rumi.jpg?itok=8eeuU7yD","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/rumi.jpg?itok=FlFWaGXq"],"endDate":"2018-01-28T00:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-28T00:00:00-08:00","description":"Join us on Sunday, January 28, 2018, at 2 PM at the Bethlehem Centre as we gather in community for music, meditation, and readings of mystic poets.

In order to make any positive impact in this world, there is a necessity to purify our relationship to power and vulnerability so that we can know deep in our hearts who we are and what we are here for. Power without domination and vulnerability without self-pity is the magical blend for soulful living. In this inspiring and challenging talk, Ya’Acov Darling Khan will talk about power and vulnerability as the twin keys for taking our place as empowered, creative and conscious human beings whose intention is to make as much positive impact in the world as we possibly can.Ya'Acov Darling Khan has been studying and practicing shamanism all his life. When he was 21, he was hit by lightning and resolved to learn to use the shamanic gifts he had experienced as a child. He has been recognised as a practicing shaman by Elder Shamans from the Sami (European tradition), and Achuar and Sápara peoples of the Amazon. He is the Co-Creator of Movement Medicine, a contemporary and dynamic shamanic practice designed to support people from all walks of life to be who they are and give what they’ve got. Ya’Acov’s talks come straight from the heart. He inspires us, often with great humour, to remember who we are. He is the Co-Author of Movement Medicine - How to Dance, Awaken and Live your Dreams, (Hay House 2009) and the author of Jaguar in the Body, Butterfly in the Heart (Hay House 2017).

As the sun starts to set, a new world emerges, and our hero finds himself caught up in a frightening scenario. Danger lurks, and as the light fades things get stranger and stranger.The tools of the trade here are puppetry, animation, shadow play and live performance, and there’s joy in seeing how much the show’s creators can do with what they have. They know that with resourcefulness and the power of suggestion, a complete world can be evoked. In that world a man fights off the dying of the light, and his struggle is turned into the stuff of adventure and redemption.

For the last 30 years, Burrows has been committed to exploring the medium of cast pigment polymer resin focusing on colour fields. The panels included in this exhibition recall and reflect the geography of a coast peopled for untold millennia in the curve of time.The Curve of Time borrows its name from the eponymous memoir of M. W. Blanchet. Following the disappearance of her husband, Blanchet and her children lived aboard a vessel to allow for the summer rental of the family’s onshore home. Blanchet's travel log commences in 1926 and recounts the fifteen summers she spent cruising the British Columbia coast in a small gasoline powered launch with her five children.Blanchet’s The Curve of Time served as a catalyst for Burrows, whose eight-meter boat, Caprice spurred the artist to acquire his own vessel which he fondly named Gina Marie. The artist's journey under the sail of Gina Marie culminates in a lucid picture of life afloat complex tidal waters.ABOUT THE ARTISTTom Burrows received a B.A. in Art History and Sociology from the University of British Columbia in 1967, and continued post-graduate studies in sculpture at St. Martin's School of Art, London, England until 1969. He has held solo exhibitions in London, Tokyo, Berlin, New York, and across Canada. Following the immediate succession of solo exhibitions by Rodney Graham and Ai Weiwei at the Helen and Morris Belkin Art Gallery, the institute mounted a 50-year survey of Burrows’ work in 2015. Most recently, polymer resin works were acquired for the permanent collection of Canada House, in Trafalgar Square, London, and the HBC Global Art Collection in New York.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2585396,"lng":-123.1389564},"southwest":{"lat":49.2584563,"lng":-123.1394198}},"location":{"lat":49.258498,"lng":-123.1391881},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.25984693029149,"lng":-123.1378391197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2571489697085,"lng":-123.1405370802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"3045 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3J9, Canada"},{"id":"1025071","tags":["Food & Drink"],"name":"Valentine’s Couples Cooking Demo and Dinner","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/2018-02-14_valentin_sq.jpg?itok=SSMs5GVJ","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/2018-02-14_valentin_sq.jpg?itok=p9zrDG9q"],"endDate":"2018-02-14T21:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-14T18:00:00-08:00","description":"This class is couples only, you will need to book in pair.

This colour recalled in Charles Baudelaire’s poems describes sinuous streets, low heavy skies, and the sad charm of clouds swollen with water. This threatening grey, from a time past that is gloomy and cold, is entirely different from the shade used in Jasmine Wallace’s paintings. In her work this colour is dynamic, enveloping and inspiring; it is the colour of the city. Taking the tone of concrete, it allows the towers to rise above the roofs and recalls the intensity of entangled road networks. It reminds us of a city of pipes that cuts through houses and the city of electric wires that bring light. Slowly other colours emerge in the painting; they could represent a patch of blue sky, a poster washed out by the rain or the rainbow colour of a diluted drop of gas on asphalt. On the canvas, grey is mixed with white, black, green and blue, creating a palette of new colours which contrast each other in a geometric mesh. The lines cross and face at each other, they overlap, converge and repel each other. This urban maze could be a map or even the view of a mortar detail under a microscope. Colors play with lines, and we see in them, the footprints of a builder’s boot on scaffolding. The mud mixed with cement leaves the shadow of its passage.Jasmine Wallace, a Canadian artist, finds her inspiration in the city, in its colours and its lines. The underground spaces dug by the people to shelter from the cold (metro, underground galleries) and the way they have been adapting their infrastructure fascinates her. This impulse of life we get from concrete, and the constructions and deconstructions appearing and disappearing inspire the motivations of the artist. The relatively new urban history of Canada influences her fascination. Unlike the vast heritage of the Western metropolis, the speed of modulation of Canadian cities allows one to witness enormous changes. Through the echoing of jackhammers and cranes stretching across the sky, buildings come out of the ground. But sometimes these manifestations end before they are aware realized, building plans are interrupted and then abandoned. In these empty spaces, one can read the contemporary writing of ruins. These places testify a time that is bygone or has never existed, and yet, a new life appears in these other spaces. Squatters and graffiti fill the rooms – like an ecosystem that doesn’t accept emptiness, entity life invests itself into every part of the city.This idea of adaptability, of a cycle, is found on Wallace’s canvas. Each sign of life, each step, participate in the construction. The evolution of a city is part of a loop that wraps to infinity. To point out these actions, Wallace leaves all signs of work visible on the canvas. As one builds a city with embossed patterns and shadowed passageways, with both simple and intricate meshes, similarly the artist weaves her work. The process is established by the accumulation of the repetitive stratification of forms and structures. What underlies these paintings is that we can build with anything.

Expanding on the Scottish and Acadian roots of PEI’s traditional music, Ten Strings and a Goatskin weave old-school Franco-Canadian, Breton, Irish, and Scottish tunes with wickedly current grooves and clever quirks, flirting with indie’s best moments.Advance tickets available at roguefolk.bc.ca, as well as at Highlife Records &amp; Tapestry Music Vancouver.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2630426,"lng":-123.176235},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2643915802915,"lng":-123.1748860197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2616936197085,"lng":-123.1775839802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"3214 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V6K 2L2, Canada"},{"id":"1004201","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"George Colligan Trio with Buster Williams and Lenny White","endDate":"2018-02-24T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-23T20:00:00-08:00","description":"George Colligan is one of the most original and compelling multi-instrumentalists of his generation.

Tamar Ilana defies easy categorization. The Toronto-born singer’s voice is as fierce and powerful as it is delicate and ornamental, and she is as comfortable enchanting heart-wrenching flamenco arrangements in Spanish as she is breathing mournful Sephardic love songs, or singing playful Balkan party tunes. With her Canadian Folk Music Award-nominated ensemble Ventanas, Ilana skips effortlessly from one genre to the next, and in her original compositions blends these diverse influences with a mastery that makes their synthesis sound like the most natural thing in the world.ABOUT LACHE CERCEL ROMA-SWING ENSEMBLE – www.lachecercel.comBefore leaving his homeland, Lache Cercel was one of Romania’s premier musicians. From a musical family, he trained at the Academy of Arts in Bucharest, became a soloist with the Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra and, in 1986, was awarded the “Artist of the People” Citation by the Romanian government. He calls his fusion Roma Jazz or Roma Swing. In the tradition of Django Reinhardt and Stephen Grappelli, Cercel lays classical and improvisational jazz alongside traditional renderings, which makes for a phenomenal sound.Cercel is a bandleader who lets every musician shine. He plays with the outrageous virtuosity found in contemporary European Roma recordings, and adds his own vision, relaxing the form somewhat. The musicians play with freedom and the listener feels the strong roots and hears the history of tragedy, struggle and ultimate survival that is part of Roma music.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2789001,"lng":-123.0847549},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2802490802915,"lng":-123.0834059197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2775511197085,"lng":-123.0861038802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"600 Campbell Ave, Vancouver, BC V6A 3K1, Canada"},{"id":"1010771","tags":["Other"],"name":"Story Circle for Adults","endDate":"2018-01-26T11:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-12T10:15:00-08:00","description":"This drop-in is for adults with developmental disabilities and their families, friends and caregivers.

Jackson and David Milne. As a genre historically dominated by male painters, emerging artist Mel Gausden marks a departure from the landscape tradition by centralizing the experience of women in nature, and her own in ﻿Girls Gone Wild, the artist's inaugural exhibition at Bau-Xi Vancouver.Typically overlooked in traditional landscape painting, Gausden's canvases feature women as outdoors people: active participants who build fires, climb fences, and carry their own canoes. Her female subjects, often situated or leaving evidence of their trace, discover themselves within the natural environment in which they gather, explore and commune.The visual culture of our contemporary digital age informs Gausden's unconventional palette. Neon silhouettes and brightly hued accents take reference from pre-set Instagram camera filters, fashion and consumer trends. The artist's manipulation of oil paint varies from sculptural— bending and piling thick layers of paint into matchsticks of textured impasto—to painterly— diluting paint until it drips with controlled precision— to sketchlike with her mark-making. For Gausden, the act of painting is intuitive as much as it is intentional; an exploratory act of personal and cultural identity which fuses past and present influences to create new possibilities for representation.ABOUT THE ARTISTMel Gausden explores themes of personal and cultural identity through traditions of self-portraiture and landscape painting. Her interests lie in combining visual markers and signifiers of nostalgia and Canadiana with painterly gesture, mark-making and bold highlights. The artist applies neon silhouettes evocative of “instagram-esque” colour filters to highlight the inherent distortion of our own personal narratives. In the end, these visual narratives end up as hybrids, part-reality and part-dreamscape.Mel Gausden earned her Bachelor’s of Arts at the Ontario College of Art and Design in 2009. She continues to live and work out of her studio in Toronto.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2585396,"lng":-123.1389564},"southwest":{"lat":49.2584563,"lng":-123.1394198}},"location":{"lat":49.258498,"lng":-123.1391881},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.25984693029149,"lng":-123.1378391197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2571489697085,"lng":-123.1405370802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"3045 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3J9, Canada"},{"id":"1027011","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Olaf deShield and Grooveline","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/olaf_de_shield_3.jpg?itok=fudptfga","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/olaf_de_shield_3.jpg?itok=vsMpPwYn"],"endDate":"2018-02-25T17:15:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-25T16:00:00-08:00","description":"Celebrating Black History Month, Olaf deShield, a fine vocalist and one of Vancouver's best guitarists.

Many of the bereaved have reported that they keep their dream experiences hidden from others due to the judgments people have pertaining to such dreams. When the bereaved do gain the courage to share them or ask questions on the topic, it is common for those who support them to not know how to respond. What do we make of these dreams and how does it apply to one's grief?Morning Presentation 9:00am - 11:00am ($10) - This talk will focus on discussing the top 10 things Joshua Black (one of the leading academic researchers in the field of dreams of the deceased) and Jade Karling Black have learned from researching dreams of the deceased (human loss and pet loss).Afternoon Workshop 1:00pm – 4:30pm ($20) - This workshop will discuss what led Joshua to this field of research (for his MA and PhD) and he will review the research on grief dreams, including his own studies. Research he has conducted includes investigating dream content and theme changes in a dream journal, common themes in dreams of the deceased, and variables that predict recalling dreams of the deceased. His PhD research on grief dreams has focused on an adult population that have suffered the death of a romantic partner/spouse, pet dog or cat, and a baby through miscarriage/still birth. Additionally, Joshua will discuss conversations about such dreams that he has had with the bereaved and those who support them. There will be a focus in this workshop on learning how to explore these dreams with clients in ways that can facilitate the processing of their grief in a safe space. This is not about dream interpretation, but about what questions to ask based on the imagery. By asking the right questions, the bereaved can connect their dream imagery to waking life, and can open dialogue on concerns or comforts that come from the experience.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.1701697,"lng":-121.9645173},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.17151868029151,"lng":-121.9631683197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.16882071970851,"lng":-121.9658662802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"9201 Corbould St, Chilliwack, BC V2P 1T9, Canada"},{"id":"1013496","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Wednesday Noon Hours: Duo Concertante","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/duo_concertante_9994x_web.jpg?itok=wb-HO0G-","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/duo_concertante_9994x_web.jpg?itok=NfkYrRxf"],"endDate":"2018-01-17T13:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-17T12:00:00-08:00","description":"Duo Concertante performs an array of pieces by Dallapiccola, Gougeon, Brahms and Gillespie (arr.

The origin of the rule is best summed up by the poignant, pronoun-adjusted excerpt from Alcoholics Anonymous’ Tradition Four cited above, a treatise on how to find harmony between ambition and self-awareness, and how to learn one’s lessons with humor and humility. This truism, officially worded as “Don’t Take Yourself Too Damn Seriously,” is the origin of both the title and ethos of Whitney Rose’s album, Rule 62. Rewind to January 2017. Rose was primed to release South Texas Suite, a countrypolitan valentine to Austin, Texas. (Rolling Stone noted that it “bristles with local flavor.”) Days before the EP hit the streets and Rose kicked off a four-month worldwide tour, the burgeoning songwriting force (and “country hair” disciple) packed her boots for Nashville, where she entered BlackBird Studio A to reconvene with the Mavericks’ Raul Malo. In one short week, Rose, Malo and co-producer Niko Bolas channeled the tumult, turbulence and tension outside of the studio into Rose’s sophomore worldwide release, which includes nine self-penned songs. Playful yet uncompromising, Whitney Rose reminds us of popular music’s rich history of strong female voices and perspectives, and on Rule 62, she channels her inner Nancy Sinatra, Bobbie Gentry and Françoise Hardy. Rule 62 finds Rose “breaking up with patriarchy,” a breakup evidenced by new songs that show verve, swagger and self-assurance in Rose’s instinctive sense of tone, broadened scope and attention to detail.Doors: 8PM// 19+RAILWAY STAGE &amp; BEER CAFÉ579 Dunsmuir Streethttp://www.facebook.com/railwaySBChttp://www.twitter.com/railwaySBChttp://www.instagram.com/railwaySBCFor more information email railway@donnellygroup.ca.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2828958,"lng":-123.1150214},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2842447802915,"lng":-123.1136724197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2815468197085,"lng":-123.1163703802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"579 Dunsmuir St, Vancouver, BC V6B 3K4, Canada"},{"id":"1019821","tags":["Festivals"],"name":"Lunar New Year Festival","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/fb-lunarfest-post-v2-03.png?itok=zwIP03Wl","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/fb-lunarfest-post-v2-03.png?itok=ax7-VbKe"],"endDate":"2018-03-04T00:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-18T00:00:00-08:00","description":"Ring in the Lunar New Year at events across Vancouver and Richmond this February!

Born of a Nigerian father and a German mother her lineage, like her music, explores the globe then brings it back home. Her gypsy journey has collected a diverse range of sounds and styles which she weaves into an orchestration strong enough to support her strong lyrics and relentless vocals. As varied as her influences may be they culminate in an expression of the blues that is undoubtedly Ndidi. On her debut No, I Never, Ndidi Onukwulu proved she can wrap her silky voice around anything from country blues to her own rootsy salon sound.

Her work blends chaos and harmony, influenced by her diverse and varied life experiences. Particularly compelling to Pearson is the richness in the textures, both visual and emotional, that mixed media evokes. Pearson draws, paints, scrapes, collages, sands and repeats to create her mixed media pieces.“I started out painting images that I thought were beautiful but evolved to a place where I now have no reference material nor any end goal in mind…This often can result in frustration and despair but has taught me so much about dealing with my own emotions and the need to let go of control.”Jodi Stark is a designer, beachcomber and woodworker. She finds beauty hidden in old scrape wood and driftwood and then re-purposes, refines and shapes it into new and modern pieces of artwork that is functional, stylish and unique.“The intersection between art, design and nature fascinates and inspires me…Now you can have all the smooth luxury, natural appeal, beauty and warmth of wood with you all day.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.3362205,"lng":-123.0779624},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.33756948029149,"lng":-123.0766134197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.33487151970849,"lng":-123.0793113802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"355 W Queens Rd, North Vancouver, BC V7N 2K6, Canada"},{"id":"1004181","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Dave King Trio","endDate":"2018-02-18T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-18T20:00:00-08:00","description":"One of the most celebrated drummers in modern jazz, The Bad Plus’ Dave King plays with fellow Minnesota native Billy Peterson on bass and New Yorker Matt Mitchell on piano.

Within the periodic table, we have a good understanding of how the elements from hydrogen to iron are produced, but the details of how the elements from iron to uranium came to be are still shrouded in mystery.Discover how TRIUMF - Canada's particle accelerator centre, located on the southern end of UBC's Point Grey campus - has evolved over its 50-year history, from corralling stellar explosions to tuning into neutron-star collisions, to become a Canadian pioneer in studying the atomic nuclei and galactic events that give rise to the stardust we are all made of.This lecture is presented in partnership by TRIUMF and Science World as part of the TRIUMF 50th Anniversary Unveiling the Universe Lecture Series.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2733626,"lng":-123.1038728},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2747115802915,"lng":-123.1025238197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2720136197085,"lng":-123.1052217802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1455 Quebec St, Vancouver, BC V6A 3Z7, Canada"},{"id":"1026091","tags":["Festivals","Kids' Stuff"],"name":"Family Day on the Drive 2018","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/family_day_on_the_drive.jpg?itok=np9nD6LU","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/family_day_on_the_drive.jpg?itok=gK4hkeOQ"],"endDate":"2018-02-12T15:30:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-12T13:00:00-08:00","description":"The Commercial Drive Business Society (CDBS) is proud to present our 3rd Annual 'Family Day on The Drive', a free community event.You are invited to join us on Monday, February 12, for an afternoon of events and activities for the entire family at Britannia Ice Rink between 1pm and 3:30pm.You are invited to Britannia Community Centre for an afternoon of FREE family driven activities, including the ever-popular TELUS KIDS CRAFT ZONE, Ice-Skating, Hot Drinks and Treats, Face Painter, a Balloon Twister, and your very own Caricature Artist extraordinaire!EVENTS PLANNEDTIMETELUS KIDS CRAFT ZONE1:00pm to 3:30pmIce-Skating\t1:00pm to 3:30pmHot Drinks + Treats\t1:00pm to 3:30pmFace Painter\t1:00pm to 3:30pmBalloon Twister\t1:00pm to 3:30pmCaricature Artist\t1:00pm to 3:30pm","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2750639,"lng":-123.0704248},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2764128802915,"lng":-123.0690758197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2737149197085,"lng":-123.0717737802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1661 Napier St, Vancouver, BC V5L 3X1, Canada"},{"id":"1025251","tags":["Dance"],"name":"DJ Night at Hot Club Swing!","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/teeeens.jpg?itok=bcmeqP29","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/teeeens.jpg?itok=mR7rbPr2"],"endDate":"2018-02-03T23:45:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-03T20:00:00-08:00","description":"Join us on Saturday, Feb. 3 for our monthly DJ night!

Not only is it Valentine’s Week, but it’s Veg Speed Date’s first anniversary! To celebrate, we’re bringing events from coast to coast, so veg*ns can take over Valentine’s even bigger in 2018. Last year, our Valentine’s launch events inspired 240+ veg love connections across North America. This year we’re aiming to top that. Join us and be one of the many veg*ns who will start their veg love stories!OUR MATCH GUARANTEEIf you don't make a dating or friendship match your first try, your second event is half price. See details here:https://findveglove.com/guaranteeABOUT THE EVENTThis event is for vegan and vegetarian singles, ages 19+, and the pairing format will be male/female speed dating. (We'd love to also offer LGBTQ events in Vancouver, let us know if you're interested!).ABOUT VEG SPEED DATEWe help people find veg love, creating life-changing matches and love stories in the veg community. Veg Speed Date is exclusively for vegan and vegetarian singles. We have thought through every detail to make sure people have a great time, don’t need to worry about feeling rejected, and have the best chance of making that special connection. Since February 2017 we’ve been successfully running events in cities all over North America. Our events have generated 700+ veg love connections and we're just getting started!WHAT TO EXPECT AT THIS EVENTExpect a fun, friendly, and incredibly effective way to meet veg singles. Think of it like mini-chats, just getting to know someone, face-to-face, for a few minutes. Spots are limited to 30 participants, because we’ve found that an intimate, get-to-really-know-you setting works the best for making real connections. We also make sure there’s an equal gender ratio – or very close to it – at every one of our male/female pairing events. Our online matching system is easy to use, smartphone compatible, and serves up your results faster than any other speed dating provider. By popular request, we now support both dating and friendship matches!","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2741199,"lng":-123.0696903},"southwest":{"lat":49.274043,"lng":-123.0699705}},"location":{"lat":49.27408140000001,"lng":-123.0698304},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.27543043029149,"lng":-123.0684814197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.27273246970849,"lng":-123.0711793802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1191 Commercial Dr, Vancouver, BC V5L 3X3, Canada"},{"id":"1023566","tags":["Markets"],"name":"New West Craft: Love Local Market","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/nwc-feb3-insta.jpg?itok=pXHPeud3","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/nwc-feb3-insta.jpg?itok=g15f-cP-"],"endDate":"2018-02-03T16:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-03T11:00:00-08:00","description":"New West Craft is celebrating our love of local and handmade.

After travelling and living in South America, moved back to Vancouver where she attended Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design. Generally using traditional oil medium, she has developed a more realistically inclined style with hints of dreaminess and ethereality. Amanda aims to explore our natural surroundings while at the same time composing comparisons to our own experiences and conditions as humans. Amanda hopes to continue to use her commitment to her painting as a way to study, learn and explore where we live and our own relationships to that.For more information, please visit www.deerlakeartgallery.eventbrite.com","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.239272,"lng":-122.968702},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2406209802915,"lng":-122.9673530197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2379230197085,"lng":-122.9700509802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"6584 Deer Lake Ave, Burnaby, BC V5G 3T7, Canada"},{"id":"1025536","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/nomercy_180129.jpg?itok=rAddJIhG","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/nomercy_180129.jpg?itok=jMFGbrPS"],"endDate":"2018-08-23T19:30:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-08-23T19:30:00-07:00","description":"American blues-folk singer-songwriter and American blues artist tour in support of upcoming albumNo Mercy in This Land.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2798019,"lng":-123.120423},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2811508802915,"lng":-123.1190740197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2784529197085,"lng":-123.1217719802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"601 Smithe St, Vancouver, BC V6B 1L7, Canada"},{"id":"1022661","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Phenix Warren","endDate":"2018-02-25T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-25T20:00:00-08:00","description":"The Live Agency + Live Acts presents:Phenix Warren with special guests Sam Lynch, Molly Aspinall and Bre McDanielPhenix Warren (Vancouver) // https://www.phenixwarren.com/Phenix is a Vancouver BC / Calgary AB based singer songwriter hailing from Calgary Alberta. With beautifully intimate live shows, and backlog of home recorded song's soon to be released on a full length LP Phenix Warren is hitting the Canadian music scene with quiet, reflective stories.Sam Lynch (Vancouver) // http://www.samlynchmusic.com/Sam Lynch is a daydreamer, a wanderer, and a restless mind, who sings her heart onto her sleeve by way of reflective, honest lyrics, and a nuanced, emotionally transparent live performance. She stands armed with a guitar and a voice that carries echoes from decades passed—yet still commands space in the current tapestry—garnering her comparisons to the likes of Feist and Cat Power. The stark honesty in Sam’s writing translates a sense of immediacy to her stories: some very personal and detailed, others more sweeping and symbolic. Sam seeks out the sweet spots where vulnerability and strength meet, where guarded hearts find companionship, and where connection shines light into darkness. Sam currently resides in Vancouver, BC, where she is preparing to release her debut EP in 2018.Molly Aspinall (Vancouver) //Artist based out of Vancouver, B.C.Bre McDaniel (Vancouver) // http://www.bremcdaniel.com/Bre McDaniel's voice has been described as magic on toast. Her songs hold a painterly attention in the way she crafts lyric images and sonic palettes, perhaps a result of her discovering herself as a songwriter during her degree in visual arts.

Mirsepassi will focus on a scholarly debate concerning the legacy of the French philosopher, Henry Bergson, to better reflect upon the place of Persian Erfan, and Islamic mysticism, in the making of modern Iran throughout the 1930s. He will also discuss a public “ideological debate,” in 1980, on the manner of “reconciling” Islamic “spiritual” tradition with modern secular ideologies, in Iran’s post-Revolutionary period.Mirsepassi will argue that a clear shift occurred, from imagining Iran as a modern and cosmopolitan nation, in the post-Mashruteh period, to a new national social imaginary, defined by religious identity and “national” tradition. This shift created a nationally unifying narrative, shared by a substantial majority of Iranians, across political, cultural, and ideological divides, as well as multiple sensibilities. These included secular and religious oppositional currents, and the ruling elites themselves.As seating is limited, reservations are recommended.

Illustrating Ono’s long standing artistic quest in social activism and world peace, this instructional work will transform the historic Wing Sang building into an intimate space for creative expression and bring people together in an act of collective healing and meditation. Drawn from the internationally recognized Rennie Collection, the installation will run from March 1 to March 31, 2018.First conceptualized in 1966, the work immerses the visitor in a dream-like state. Viewers enter into an all-white space and are welcomed to take a seat at the table to reassemble fragments of ceramic coffee cups and saucers using the provided twine, tape, and glue. Akin to the Japanese philosophy of Wabi-sabi, an embracing of the flawed or imperfect, Mend Piece encourages the participant to transform broken fragments into an object that prevails its own violent rupture. The mended pieces are then displayed on shelves installed around the room. The contemplative act of mending is intended to promote reparation starting within one’s self and community, and bridge the gap created by violence, hatred, and war. In the words of Yoko Ono herself, “Mend with wisdom, mend with love. It will mend the earth at the same time.”The installation of MEND PIECE, Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York City version at Rennie Museum will be accompanied by an espresso bar, furthering the notions of community and togetherness.Book your visit starting February 13, 2018.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2806995,"lng":-123.1031317},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2820484802915,"lng":-123.1017827197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2793505197085,"lng":-123.1044806802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"51 E Pender St, Vancouver, BC V6A 1S9, Canada"},{"id":"1027006","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Don Stewart and Mike Henry","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/don_stewart_feb._11_2018.jpg?itok=Elqp7Ng6","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/don_stewart_feb._11_2018.jpg?itok=JNT10utJ"],"endDate":"2018-02-11T17:15:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-11T16:00:00-08:00","description":"Celebrating Black History Month, Don Stewart and Mike Henry sing their way into our hearts.

Listen to “Foul beats,” Boris’s first track for revered techno label SCI+TECH, and it’s all right there. Add to that “in the house” on Suara along with his own releases on his own label Transmit and his Transmissions podcast that’s aired on 57 stations across 36 countries.There are overnight sensations, and then there’s Boris. Baptized in the booths of New York City, the Russian native learned the craft of DJ-ing in front of the most demanding crowds in the world, developing a deep sense of what moves a packed floor in a moment, an hour, or a full night-to-morning extended session. From early 90s to today, he’s been a resident at every major New York nightclub (including Pacha, Crobar, and Roxy), and received award nominations for his service (Club World Awards, America’s Best DJ), not to mention the adoration of dedicated fans (who boldly declare that they “Believe in Boris”). He’s also released several compilations on local label Nervous: Timeless capsules of the sounds of the city.But New York is just the beginning of the story. Boris has played regularly at clubs all over the globe, from United States hotspots like Space (Miami) and Space ( NYC) to overseas legendary venues like Womb in Japan. With appearances at festivals in Mexico, Canada and a regular at BPM (Mexico) he has also brought his particular set of skills to South America, London, Korea, Japan, and Ibiza. 2015 has seen Boris debut at NY brand new Ibiza Transplant Space Ibiza NY with 2 shows already selling out to his loyal NY fans.Now, Boris is parlaying all that international intelligence into new productions that represent a fresh musical direction. New Generation, his aptly named debut EP on SCI+TECH (the venerable underground label of legendary artist Dubfire), is deep techno with an energetic BPM: One cut of undeniable funk (“Generate”) and one of undeniable filth (“Foul Beats”), each meant to take the night to the next level. Recent releases that have topped the charts have been his “In da houz” and “BE” released on Coyu’s hot label Suara, along with “over it” out on Tool Room and “love perc” out on Carl Cox’s label Intec.

Christou’s inaugural exhibition at Bau-Xi Gallery showcases the artist’s exploration of acrylic paint, and an investigation of the subtle shifts in the perception of colour.Vicky Christou pays homage to the tradition of craft and women’s domestic labour through her sculptural paintings. Since 1990, she has devoted her practice to the full expression of line and form. Christou meticulously applies lines of paint synchronized to one full meditative breath. Paint accumulates line by line, layer upon layer, each colour shrinking and expanding at different rates: a visual record of time and human consciousness.The colour white features predominantly in Undertone, unique for its lack of hue and its ability to fully reflect and scatter all wavelengths of light. Rife with poetic metaphor, Christou’s grid acts as a veil that conceals and reveals. The simplicity of the grid, and uniformity of the square formats are intentional choices for Christou. Its small-scale both an invitation to view the work intimately, and to recognize and contemplate the fleeting qualities of light and time: “I like duplicity and what it reveals: what we first see and know, and what light and shade reveal to us from different vantage points and at different times. I find that transitory passage inspiring and poetic, like watching the day`s light fade into evening.” With dozens of painted marks repeated, Christou’s highly textured surfaces culminate into an artifact of making which defy traditional distinctions between painting, sculpture and craft.ABOUT THE ARTISTBorn in Melbourne, Australia, Vicky Christou immigrated to Canada in 1969 and is a graduate of the Emily Carr College of Art and Design.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2585396,"lng":-123.1389564},"southwest":{"lat":49.2584563,"lng":-123.1394198}},"location":{"lat":49.258498,"lng":-123.1391881},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.25984693029149,"lng":-123.1378391197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2571489697085,"lng":-123.1405370802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"3045

Members in good standing attending this meeting get into the screening for free.THE FILMLuk’Luk’IRunning time: 90 minutesNationalism gets a reality check in Wayne Wapeemukwa's uncompromising debut feature, an expansion of his 2014 short of the same name, following the lives of five Vancouverites living on society's fringes during the 2010 Olympics. The film takes us into uncharted territory, perched somewhere between fiction we must see and documentary we wish didn't exist.As with Wapeemukwa's short films, many of the actors play characters based on their own experiences: a mother and part-time sex worker; a father juggling parenting and his landscaping job with a heroin addiction; a larger-than-life street celebrity who roller-skates around town; an addict who, consistently failed by the system, has recurring visions of being taken away to another world; and a man with a physical impairment who is just trying to make it on his own and get to the hockey finals. These vulnerable five form a community that stands in stark contrast to the glittering backdrop of the Olympics.Highly impactful in demonstrating what a country chooses to believe in and how it acts in reality, Luk'Luk'I is a cinematic punch in the gut and one of the most interestingly constructed films of the year.THE CAUSEPortland Hotel SocietyPHS Community Services Society strives to develop, maintain and promote affordable housing for adult individuals who are poorly served elsewhere in the community due to their physical health, mental health, behavioural issues, substance dependencies, forensic history, and for those who are homeless.

As pertinent today as when it was written during World War II, The Skin of Our Teeth celebrates humanity’s resilience in the face of climate change, floods, fire, plague and war. The cast of colourful characters includes the Antrobus family, their maid Sabina, a pet dinosaur and a woolly mammoth. Combining tragedy with comedy, wit, intelligence and imagination, the play, as Francis Fergusson wrote, is ‘a marriage of Plato and Groucho Marx.’ Written in 1942, THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH was Wilder’s 6th play and would win him his 3rd Pulitzer Prize.

Born in Israel, but making his home in Vancouver, Itamar's music holds a depth and sensitivity that touches listeners deeply; It blends the delicateness of Middle Eastern music, the freedom found in Jazz and the passion of Flamenco, creating a unique sound all his own.Rounding out the presentation is the internationally renowned Whirling Dervish, Raqib Brian Burke and his guest ensemble, known for their strong adherence to the spiritual Sufi tradition while exploring new movement vocabulary that reaches deep into the soul of those watching them.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2803846,"lng":-123.112661},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2817335802915,"lng":-123.1113120197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2790356197085,"lng":-123.1140099802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"600 Hamilton St, Vancouver, BC V6B 2P1, Canada"},{"id":"1022621","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"TDE: The Championship Tour","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/kendrick-lamar-hot-.jpg?itok=tSxebLjZ","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/kendrick-lamar-hot-.jpg?itok=VYt65a_D"],"endDate":"2018-05-04T19:30:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-05-04T19:30:00-07:00","description":"Rap show featuring Kendrick Lamar, SZA, ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, SiR, and Lance Skiiiwalker.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2785085,"lng":-123.1078277},"southwest":{"lat":49.2773571,"lng":-123.1098558}},"location":{"lat":49.27793279999999,"lng":-123.1088418},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2792817802915,"lng":-123.1074927697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2765838197085,"lng":-123.1101907302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"800 Griffiths Way, Vancouver, BC V6B 6G1, Canada"},{"id":"1024226","tags":["Other"],"name":"SFU Philosophers&#039; Café","endDate":"2018-02-28T20:30:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-07T18:30:00-08:00","description":"Your chance to discuss philosophical issues with members of your community.************Buddhism and psychedelicsWednesday, Feb. 7, 6:30 p.m. - 8 p.m.Mount Pleasant Branch, 1 KingswayInformation: 604-665-3962************Why is a sense of belonging so fundamental?Thursday, Feb. 8, 7 p.m. - 8:30 p.m.Joe Fortes Branch, 870 Denman St.Information: 604-665-3972************Do religion and the church still have roles to play in Western music?Friday, Feb. 9, 12:30 p.m. - 2 p.m.Oakridge Branch, 191 - 650 W. 41st Ave.Information: 604-665-3980************Sacred and profane: opposites in your everyday experienceFriday, Feb. 9, 5 p.m. - 6:30 p.m.Carnegie Branch, 401 Main St.Information: 604-665-3010************Where would you live anywhere in the world?Saturday, Feb. 10, 3 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.Hastings Branch, 2674 E.

It tells the story of two estranged brothers from Dublin: Jason is a would-be DJ, Daniel a washed-up junkie. After years apart, they meet during a long, wild weekend. Their tentative bonding is set against the backdrop of memories: of the music they raved to, the drugs they thrilled to and the city of their birth and, perhaps, rebirth.Kirwan and co-star Ian Lloyd Anderson play multiple roles throughout, and mix spoken word slang-talk with naturalistic dialogue and poetic reflections. It’s speech as music—a feast for the ears. What Dublin Oldschool offers in the end is a gesture towards love and hope—a wish that they might triumph over addiction and the passage of time.

It's a culmination of many years playing music together in a small Vancouver suburb.+The Thick Of It (Vancouver) // https://www.reverbnation.com/thethickofitSince 2008 this is the third line-up for THE THICK OF IT and the third coming of a different sound for the band.In 2008 a 5 song EP titled \" Destroyed \" was released , the songs were more acoustic rock driven and were well received by fans. After a few years of playing shows and writing the band went back into the studio to record more music and ended up with a full length album titled \" First Day Of Death\" which was released in July of 2010. This album had a mix of acoustic rock and heavier rock songs and showed how the band was evolving it's sound into they're heavier scope of writing .Then after a break the band decided to record 2 all acoustic songs which they descretely released in 2013. Over the next few years all band members were also playing in other projects, local and international but all the while still writing new music for THE THICK OF IT.Although the live shows were less often the writing of new material was still going strong. In March of 2017 local producer Kris Siegers took a interest in the band and eagerly wanted to record new songs. Kris had worked with Russ Bergquist , the bassist for the band in the past but did not know the other members. Kris wanted to capture the pure essence and sound of the band and immediately had chemistry with all members of THE THICK OF IT. To say that these new songs demand the listeners attention is a understatement, the new music created by these seasoned, pure musicians is \" Beautifully Crushing\" . Kris Siegers achieved his production goals and then some by not only capturing the sound of the band but taking it to a new level.The band will release the songs as singles one at a time every few months starting in 2018. The band will be releasing updated information on releases as soon as the songs are 100% ready to share with the world.Show: 9 PM // 19+RAILWAY STAGE &amp; BEER CAFÉ579 Dunsmuir Streethttp://www.facebook.com/railwaySBChttp://www.twitter.com/railwaySBChttp://www.instagram.com/railwaySBCFor more information email railway@donnellygroup.ca.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2828958,"lng":-123.1150214},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2842447802915,"lng":-123.1136724197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2815468197085,"lng":-123.1163703802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"579 Dunsmuir St, Vancouver, BC V6B 3K4, Canada"},{"id":"1021016","tags":["Galleries","Food & Drink"],"name":"Ghost Spring Exhibition Happening #3","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/derya_dilara_install_pose.jpg?itok=zJ38jO49","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/derya_dilara_install_pose.jpg?itok=lcqbWsXI"],"endDate":"2018-01-27T17:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-27T14:00:00-08:00","description":"“Ghost Spring” is a two-person show by Dilara Akay and Derya Akay looking at funeral practices within their own family in Turkey, passing down information from one generation to the next.

Drones and shifting modalities ring out from his fx-laden horn blowing.￭ JOHN KRAUSBAUER ￭John Krausbauer (b. Indianapolis) is a music conceptualist and multi-instrumentalist currently based in Oakland. He has performed his music for over 20 years in a multitude of settings - from basements and rock clubs to colleges and art galleries. Numerous recordings of his work have been released on independent labels in the US, Europe, and soon in Japan.In recent years his focus has been on his solo work, involving ritual endurance happenings with voice and violin, accompanied by synth and strobes; his compositions, mainly concerned with systems-based phasing constructions; the Ecstatic Music Band, exploring just tunings with amplified strings at high volumes and long durations, with stroboscopic lighting; The Essentialists, a country-blues-boogie-raga guitar/violin duo; and most recently the formation of the \"M\"inimalist psych-punk group, Night Collectors.￭ KAORI SUZUKI ￭Kaori Suzuki (b. Tokyo) is a composer of electronic and electroacoustic music living in Oakland. Her musical works are concerned with inner-sensory responses and transformative states, often emphasizing duration and dynamics through meticulous synthesis techniques. Her electronic performances often involve spatialization and high volumes to build saturated frequency interactions and resonances in the room. Her projects include her handmade instrument building platform Magic Echo Music, various solo/collaborative compositions with analog synthesis, and recently her solo computer music utilizing spectral properties of transducer-driven objects combined with the use of auditory distortion products and other inner-ear phenomena.She has performed her music in various settings in the west coast of America including numerous DIY venues and galleries, music festivals such as Debacle Fest, TUFFest, and the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival, and academic institutions such as Mills College, Stanford (CCRMA), and Berkeley Art Museum. She holds a master’s degree in Electronic Music and Recording Media from Mills College, and has a forthcoming album release in March 2018.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2569659,"lng":-123.0907421},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2583148802915,"lng":-123.0893931197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2556169197085,"lng":-123.0920910802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"648 Kingsway St, Vancouver, BC V5T 3K4, Canada"},{"id":"1023896","tags":["Film"],"name":"Banking on Bitcoin","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/banking_on_bitcoin.jpg?itok=rgEMKTqo","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/banking_on_bitcoin.jpg?itok=xqM0r4xe"],"endDate":"2018-02-08T21:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-08T18:30:00-08:00","description":"Free screening of documentary film on bitcoin, \"Banking on Bitcoin\".

As the four siblings piece together their shared history, their connection deepens, bringing laughter with it, and their family begins to take shape.Screening will be followed by a conversation with director Tasha Hubbard and two of the siblings featured in Birth of a Family.DIRECTOR BIOTasha Hubbard is a writer, filmmaker, and an assistant professor at the University of Saskatchewan’s Department of English. She is from Peepeekisis First Nation in Treaty Four Territory, and is the mother of a ten-year-old son.Her research is on Indigenous efforts to return the buffalo to the lands and to Indigenous consciousness. Her first solo writing/directing project Two Worlds Colliding, about Saskatoon’s infamous Starlight Tours, premiered at ImagineNATIVE in 2004, was broadcasted on CBC’s documentary program Roughcuts in 2004, and won the Canada Award at the 2005 Geminis. Her recent short film 7 Minutes won Best Short Non-fiction at the Golden Sheaf Awards. Her NFB-produced feature documentary, Birth of a Family is about a 60s Scoop family reunited for the first time. The film landed in the top ten audience choice list at this year’s Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Film Festival. Tasha also does research on Indigenous film and is appointed to the National Film Board’s newly formed Indigenous Advisory Council.First Nations and Indigenous Studies was founded in 2001 to provide students with an understanding of the histories, contemporary realities, and political concerns of Indigenous peoples in Canada and beyond.

The survivor of a medically induced coma and acquired brain injury, creator Shannon Yee presents a chance for us to live through her medical journey. In this radically immersive production, audience members lie on hospital beds, put on headphones and enter her mind. It’s an audio experience like no other: re-enactment, internal monologue, evocative aural textures and more.What does it mean for a mind to be injured? The answer lurks beyond the objective world, behind a wall of privacy and selfhood. Here is your chance to jump over that wall, and feel a kind of empathy you may have thought impossible. Along with its psychedelic frenzy and rushes of emotion, this work is perhaps most valuable for its tender intimacy."},{"id":"1022596","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Journey and Def Leppard","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/journeylep.png?itok=4kt9-lhV","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/journeylep.png?itok=rBqmo5vA"],"endDate":"2018-10-01T20:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-10-01T20:00:00-07:00","description":"Multiplatinum rock acts from the '70s/'80s play a coheadlining show.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2785085,"lng":-123.1078277},"southwest":{"lat":49.2773571,"lng":-123.1098558}},"location":{"lat":49.27793279999999,"lng":-123.1088418},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2792817802915,"lng":-123.1074927697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2765838197085,"lng":-123.1101907302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"800 Griffiths Way, Vancouver, BC V6B 6G1, Canada"},{"id":"1021126","tags":["Galleries","Performing Arts"],"name":"All Together: MODU Korean Artist Collective","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/modu_demos_-_for_events_postings.jpg?itok=6t_v5T_u","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/modu_demos_-_for_events_postings.jpg?itok=q5jvgH6Z"],"endDate":"2018-02-03T15:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-20T13:00:00-08:00","description":"We are hosting a series of Artist’s Demos in conjunction with our gallery exhibition, All Together: MODU Korean Artist Collective.Don't miss this free family event!Saturday, January 20 | 1-3pmLena Han - Sketching in graphiteYsabella Choung - Drawing geometric shapes and patterns on potterySaturday, January 27 | 1-3pmMonica Baek - Foliage painting techniques in oilLy Won - How to make a Bojagi - Korean QuiltSaturday, February 3 |1-3pmJulia Lee - Photography demonstration - guest portraitsHee Jeong Kim - Watercolour painting on canvasThe MODU Korean Artists Collective is the leading organization of Korean-Canadian artists in Metro Vancouver.

In 1942, Kishizo Kimura saw his life upended along with tens of thousands of others. But his story is also unique; as a member of two controversial committees that oversaw the forced sale of the property of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War, Kimura participated in the dispossession of his own community. Witness to Loss chronicles a history of racism in British Columbia, describes the activities of the committees on which Kimura served, and seeks to defend his actions.Witness to Loss is presented by Landscapes of Injustice, a group dedicated to telling the story and coming to terms with the forced sale of Japanese-Canadian owned property and the uprooting of over 21,000 people of Japanese ancestry from coastal British Columbia. The Landscapes of Injustice group asks why and how the dispossession occurred, who benefited from it, and how it has been remembered and forgotten in the subsequent decades.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2776653,"lng":-123.1470528},"southwest":{"lat":49.2772953,"lng":-123.1480659}},"location":{"lat":49.27748030000001,"lng":-123.1475594},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2788292802915,"lng":-123.1462103697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2761313197085,"lng":-123.1489083302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1905 Ogden Ave, Vancouver, BC V6J 1A3, Canada"},{"id":"1020486","tags":["Other"],"name":"Sahaja Yoga Meditation","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/yoga.jpg?itok=IH1zNB63","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/yoga.jpg?itok=x_R3zVaV"],"endDate":"2018-01-18T20:30:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-18T19:00:00-08:00","description":"Experience kundalini awakening and receive self realization.. the state of complete thoughtless awareness and the benefits of stress relief, increased health, concentration and connection to the divine, as taught by her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2237079,"lng":-122.9878084},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2250568802915,"lng":-122.9864594197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2223589197085,"lng":-122.9891573802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"5291 Grimmer St, Burnaby, BC V5H 2H3, Canada"},{"id":"1020196","tags":["Other"],"name":"Heart of Desire: 3 Secrets To Loving YOU This Valentine&#039;s Day","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/screen_shot_2018-01-08_at_9.10.05_pm.png?itok=-6VSrfME","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/screen_shot_2018-01-08_at_9.10.05_pm.png?itok=czhpLm-n"],"endDate":"2018-02-05T20:30:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-05T18:30:00-08:00","description":"Come join a group of inspired women at Wildflower Beauty Bar, and experience healing through sound, heart-opening meditation, aromatherapy, and tips n’ tricks on how to celebrate YOU this Valentine’s Day!The $15 ticket can be used towards a treatment at Wildflower Beauty Bar.We look forward to seeing you at the event!","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2780346,"lng":-122.8606961},"southwest":{"lat":49.277933,"lng":-122.8607812}},"location":{"lat":49.2779838,"lng":-122.8607387},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2793327802915,"lng":-122.8593896697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2766348197085,"lng":-122.8620876302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"2318 Clarke St, Port Moody, BC V3H 1Y8, Canada"},{"id":"1021056","tags":["Festivals"],"name":"2018 LunarFest","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/2-18_lunarfest_image.jpg?itok=wMgR6IER","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/2-18_lunarfest_image.jpg?itok=PXAMoWyG"],"endDate":"2018-02-18T18:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-18T11:00:00-08:00","description":"Celebrate Year of the Dog with mankind’s best friends at the Vancouver Art Gallery Plaza!For one day only, enjoy some fantastic activities and experiences for you and your dog!

Spanning three decades from his earliest mature work to his recent large-scale creations, this extraordinary exhibition will include a recently produced five-metre tall sculpture and two specially created multi-panel paintings.For Murakami, connecting with his audience and allowing his artwork to be accessible to the general public are integral aspects of what he stands for as an artist. Murakami has created a new major public art project featuring a skull surrounded by octopus tentacles which will cover the Gallery’s Georgia Street façade, extending the exhibition outside the traditional confines of the Gallery space.“We are delighted to offer Canadian audiences the opportunity to experience a wide range of paintings and sculptures by one of the world’s most influential and visionary artists,” says Kathleen S. Bartels, director of the Vancouver Art Gallery. “In tracing Takashi Murakami’s development as an artist over the course of three decades, The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg draws attention to some of the major themes and cultural conditions that have shaped his artistic practice. We can’t wait to welcome countless visitors from Vancouver and beyond to this monumental exhibition, and for the general public to experience his work every time they pass by our Georgia Street facade.”The exhibition opens with Murakami’s early paintings from the 1980s that synthesize traditional Nihonga-style painting techniques and formats with contemporary subject matter, and goes on to trace the artist’s shift in the 1990s toward a distinctive, anime-influenced style known as Superflat. From his signature animated flowers to the iconic character Mr. DOB, a mouse-like figure that serves as part ambassador and part self-portrait, the works in the show offer an in-depth look at Murakami’s unique Superflat universe.The exhibition also features works from a recent body of paintings depicting groups of wizened Buddhist monks (Arhats), including the ten-panel 100 Arhats (2013), an ambitious work of stunning intricacy and craftsmanship. A departure from the commercial pop aesthetic that first garnered him popular acclaim, the Arhat works mark Murakami’s return to his training in traditional Japanese painting in order to find a response to the suffering caused by the massive earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan in 2011 that killed more than 15,000 people.“The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg highlights Takashi Murakami’s dedication to exquisite craftsmanship as well as his boundless imagination moving freely within an ever-expanding field of aesthetic decisions and cultural inspiration, from Buddhist folk traditions to art history to popular culture,” says Bruce Grenville, senior curator. “This wide-ranging exhibition offers a serious engagement on issues affecting Japan and the larger world today, from media culture to globalization to the threats of nuclear power.”Takashi Murakami: The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg is organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and is curated by MCA Chief Curator Michael Darling.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2830077,"lng":-123.1208179},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28435668029149,"lng":-123.1194689197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2816587197085,"lng":-123.1221668802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"750 Hornby St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 2H7, Canada"},{"id":"1019786","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Mt.

The gadgets chime, tap, click and shuffle while the humans move and speak in response. As they lock and shift, the dancers seem driven, almost desperate: the rhythm controls them. This is a triumph of engineering and a work of precision; the design of the instruments, the rigour of the dances and the music itself show a delicate, almost precarious intricacy.For all the mechanical sophistication on display, however, there’s something low-tech, even artisanal, about this show. The instruments are programmed down to the last hit, but their sounds are so palpably organic they can almost be felt as well as heard. Joining touch, sound and motion, MEETING calls on our primal impulses even as it dazzles with its sophistication.

A video poem of hers was shown Vancouver Videopoem Festival, presented by the Edgewise Electrolit Cafe. Alice’s adventures lead her to music in the new millennium. She now composes and writes songs and teaches music. She currently plays lead alto saxophone in the VCC Jazz Orchestra and also leads her own original rock band. She will be reading and singing a few songs. https://www.facebook.com/trouble11band/Isabella Mori is a mother, grandmother, wife, friend, sister. She also writes: poetry, novels, short stories and non-fiction. She has published two books of and about poetry, a bagful of haiku – 87 imperfections, and isabella mori’s teatable book. She lives in a way too-big house, enjoys being surrounded by houseplants, flowers and trees, and takes long, long walks. She grew up in Germany in a wonderfully chaotic artists’ household and spent some time in Paraguay and Chile. Isabella works in the mental health/addiction field. (Oh, and don't confuse her with Isabella Legosi Mori, another Vancouver poet.) Her musings about psychology, spirituality, creativity and social justice can be found at http://moritherapy.org, and she tweets under the name of @moritherapy.James Mullin is a rarely heard voice in poetry. He has been writing for decades. His writ follows a bardic/Celtic Christian tradition, delving into nature metaphysics, sound poetry and humour: James works at several independent bookstores in Vancouver and Burnaby, so you’ll be meeting him any time soon if you’re looking for a slightly used book any time soon. He knows a lot about books. James and the Vancouver Haiku Group, now in it’s 8th year, launched a new haiku anthology in January called The Jade Pond in which you’ll find Mullin’s haiku.And then there’s you. We have 8 open mic spots for poets to sport your poems. Please keep it to 5-10 minutes. Listening is a challenge, so that is why. We plan to take a short break.

The early feedback on the live shows was clear: lose the sketches. So the songs endured and they all remain because the band hates to throw anything out. The songs were written to make fun of a big dumb world. Luckily, the world is still dumb and The Arrogant Worms (Mike McCormick, Chris Patterson and Trevor Strong) still have plenty to sing about. The shows are fast, furious and family friendly. The wit is quick, the satire is biting and the musicianship is second to none. Their appeal has earned them fans from kids to parents to grandparents to Princess Leia. The Arrogant Worms have sold more than 160,000 copies of their 14 albums. The band has played on three continents to crowds as large as 100,000 and were recognized in 2003 as the Touring Act of the Year by the Canadian Arts Presenters Association. The Worms have entertained at corporate functions, sung anthems at sporting events and emceed at major festivals. Their songs are in school lesson plans, in textbooks and even played on the Space Shuttle. On earth or in space, everyone digs these Worms. Over a quarter century after they began, The Arrogant Worms continue to provide tuneful and silly escapism for everyone who needs it. And if you think you don’t need it, well you’re wrong. You do. The Arrogant Worms know what’s best for you and what’s best for you is The Arrogant Worms.Advance tickets available at roguefolk.bc.ca, Highlife Records, and Tapestry Music Vancouver.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2630426,"lng":-123.176235},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2643915802915,"lng":-123.1748860197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2616936197085,"lng":-123.1775839802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"3214 W 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V6K 2L2, Canada"},{"id":"994786","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"The Suffers","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/11/thesuffers_171114.jpg?itok=gHBDWfkm","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/11/thesuffers_171114.jpg?itok=kL9-ufnO"],"endDate":"2018-03-18T21:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-03-18T21:00:00-07:00","description":"Houston-based soul band composed of Kam Franklin, Adam Castaneda, Nick Zamora, Patrick Kelly, Jon Durbin, Kevin Bernier, Michael Razo, and Jose Luna.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.281962,"lng":-123.0998865},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2833109802915,"lng":-123.0985375197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2806130197085,"lng":-123.1012354802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"319 Main St, Vancouver, BC V6A 2T7, Canada"},{"id":"969091","tags":["Sports"],"name":"Canucks vs. Ducks","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/09/vancouver_canucks_170919_35.jpg?itok=jIH1g6z5","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/09/vancouver_canucks_170919_35.jpg?itok=g1aZ1mS6"],"endDate":"2018-03-27T19:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-03-27T19:00:00-07:00","description":"The Vancouver Canucks take on the Anaheim Ducks in National Hockey League action.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2785085,"lng":-123.1078277},"southwest":{"lat":49.2773571,"lng":-123.1098558}},"location":{"lat":49.27793279999999,"lng":-123.1088418},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2792817802915,"lng":-123.1074927697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2765838197085,"lng":-123.1101907302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"800 Griffiths Way, Vancouver, BC V6B 6G1, Canada"},{"id":"1005506","tags":["Performing Arts","Dance"],"name":"Shen Yun","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/12/shenyun_171207.png?itok=GFAIrVB_","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/12/shenyun_171207.png?itok=BcL7qBcM"],"endDate":"2018-03-25T00:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-03-23T00:00:00-07:00","description":"Take a journey through five millennia of Chinese culture with a multimedia show featuring ancient legends and stories, classical Chinese dancers, animated backdrops, and a live orchestra.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2798747,"lng":-123.1124716},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2812236802915,"lng":-123.1111226197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2785257197085,"lng":-123.1138205802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"650 Hamilton St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5N6, Canada"},{"id":"1007106","tags":["Concerts","Nightlife"],"name":"Motionless in White","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/12/motionless.jpg?itok=TSpe2ful","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/12/motionless.jpg?itok=Iuaijfgh"],"endDate":"2018-03-22T18:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-03-22T18:00:00-07:00","description":"MRG Concerts presents Pennsylvania metalcore band Motionless in White at the Rickshaw.

Nine Dragons is a riveting crime drama that will satisfy lovers of classic mysteries and detective stories.In 1924, Kowloon, a killer is on the loose. Tommy Lam, Hong Kong's most brilliant police detective, is brought on to investigate. Constantly overlooked by his English superiors, Tommy feels he has something to prove on this case. The leading suspect, however, is Victor Fung, the son of one of the wealthiest families in Asia. A cat-and-mouse game ensues between Tommy and his mysterious nemesis.Nine Dragons is also a compelling exploration of race and prejudice in a colonial society. On the surface, Tommy Lam is obsessed with tracking down a killer in his native Kowloon. In immersing himself in the opulent and lurid world of Victor Fung, however, Tommy finds himself investigating the mystery of his own identity.* AFTERNOON SHOWS AVAILABLE* Package options available - Tickets for all 4 Mainstage shows, or for all 6 season shows.* Subscribe and save up to 18%","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.167321,"lng":-123.147103},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.1686699802915,"lng":-123.1457540197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.1659720197085,"lng":-123.1484519802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"6500 Gilbert Rd, Richmond, BC V7C 3V4, Canada"},{"id":"969121","tags":["Sports"],"name":"Canucks vs. Coyotes","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/09/vancouver_canucks_170919_39.jpg?itok=mZMjFo9W","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/09/vancouver_canucks_170919_39.jpg?itok=CoDzSiMM"],"endDate":"2018-04-05T19:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-04-05T19:00:00-07:00","description":"The Vancouver Canucks take on the Arizona Coyotes in National Hockey League action.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2785085,"lng":-123.1078277},"southwest":{"lat":49.2773571,"lng":-123.1098558}},"location":{"lat":49.27793279999999,"lng":-123.1088418},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2792817802915,"lng":-123.1074927697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2765838197085,"lng":-123.1101907302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"800 Griffiths Way, Vancouver, BC V6B 6G1, Canada"},{"id":"1013171","tags":["Concerts","Performing Arts"],"name":"Carlos del Junco","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/carlos_del_junco_2mb.jpeg?itok=LIDPhQ25","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/carlos_del_junco_2mb.jpeg?itok=4QHTsIsF"],"endDate":"2018-03-18T20:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-03-18T20:00:00-07:00","description":"To say Carlos del Junco plays the harmonica is like saying that Jimi Hendrix plays guitar.

Audience members are seated in a theatre, with a row of children behind them, and together they experience a movie. The film has no dialogue and audience members are blindfolded, with the children describing to them in whispers. It’s a mischievous experiment in storytelling, reversing the traditional power dynamic between adults and children.In this collaboration between adult and child, there are layers of mediation the film moves through; it transforms as it passes from one mind to another. Sight, then speech, then hearing—with each step something is lost. But much more is gained: a bond of trust, the chance to join forces across an age gap, a great widening of the imagination. At the movies, we watch with the lights off. Here the darkness is doubled, and so is the power to dream—to use the silver screen within."},{"id":"926321","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Nils Frahm","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/06/nilsfrahm_170620.jpg?itok=Fbmr_7tW","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/06/nilsfrahm_170620.jpg?itok=izFuhARP"],"endDate":"2018-04-01T21:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-04-01T21:00:00-07:00","description":"Berlin-based modern classical-electronica composer and producer.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2799674,"lng":-123.1213742},"southwest":{"lat":49.27960290000001,"lng":-123.1219356}},"location":{"lat":49.2797851,"lng":-123.1216549},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2811341302915,"lng":-123.1203059197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2784361697085,"lng":-123.1230038802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"918 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1L2, Canada"},{"id":"992346","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Carpenter Brut","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/11/carpenter_brut_171108.jpg?itok=fZgSoPQv","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/11/carpenter_brut_171108.jpg?itok=TznXWgur"],"endDate":"2018-04-17T21:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-04-17T21:00:00-07:00","description":"French electronica group performs on its Leather Patrol Tour 2018.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.281962,"lng":-123.0998865},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2833109802915,"lng":-123.0985375197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2806130197085,"lng":-123.1012354802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"319 Main St, Vancouver, BC V6A 2T7, Canada"},{"id":"974016","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Uli Jon Roth &quot;An Evening With&quot;","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/09/ujr_triple-anniversary-world-tour-2018_poster_a1_preview_170921.jpg?itok=XLbaAkJC","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/09/ujr_triple-anniversary-world-tour-2018_poster_a1_preview_170921.jpg?itok=aW9yyKF2"],"endDate":"2018-06-18T23:55:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-06-18T19:00:00-07:00","description":"SCRAPE records &amp; The Invisible Orange are thrilled to bring back...An Evening With...Uli Jon Roth (http://ulijonroth.com/)“TRIPLE ANNIVERSARY WORLD TOUR”This will be a 3 hour show with an intermission!A full set of ELECTRIC SUN for the first time in the North America in 35 years, followed by a full SCORPIONS set, including a multi-media show.

This is followed by an intermission and a shorter set of the highlights from TOKYO TAPES REVISITED to round off the 3-hour extravaganza.Uli has not performed the bulk of this music for over 30 years. Although it never enjoyed the overwhelming commercial success of Scorpions, Electric Sun was far more than just a cult band and had a sizeable following on both sides of the Atlantic as well as in Japan. Largely thanks to Uli’s innovative and ground-breaking guitar playing and interesting compositions the band became artistically influential and presented a unique blend, which was sometimes likened to a strange mixture, located somewhere between Beethoven and Hendrix.Following the worldwide success of his latest SCORPIONS REVISITED releases, Uli will now revisit the spellbinding music of his first solo venture after leaving Scorpions and re-connect with his songs from that prolific era of his long and colourful career.Widely regarded as one of the greatest guitar players ever, Uli pioneered a unique style of guitar playing which - for the first time - combined complete mastery of the instrument with an intensely melodic and emotional appeal. Uli’s Electric Sun guitar solos are both uplifting and often mesmerizing, displaying a very wide variety of textures, colours and novel ideas. They always take you on a journey.From his earliest days’ onwards, Uli has always been a bold and uncompromising musical innovator of the first order and his Electric Sun period bears ample witness to that fact. Being the first guitar player in rock to incorporate complex melodic arpeggio sequences, Uli Jon Roth - in the eyes of many of his peers - practically reinvented modern guitar-technique almost singlehandedly during his Scorpions tenure, but even more so during his Electric Sun days.Uli has now taken a fresh look at this material, drawn from the altogether three Electric Sun albums which he wrote some 40 years ago. The three albums – in chronological order – were EARTHQUAKE, FIRE WIND and BEYOND THE ASTRAL SKIES. Electric Sun and Uli fans alike will be delighted to finally hear these songs played live again by the master himself.As a real bonus for his die-hard fans and connoisseurs Uli has a special treat in store which will bring many a tear to the eyes of nostalgic older fans; due to popular request, Uli will finally bring his legendary white Fender Stratocaster guitar on tour again! The famous instrument - which he used during ALMOST ALL the Scorpions and Electric Sun recordings (!) - will make an onstage appearance for a couple of songs after having remained silent for so many years... The guitar has not been played in public since the Mid-Eighties when Uli switched over to SKY GUITARS for good and he is looking forward to putting this iconic guitar through its paces for old times’ sake. The “WHITE STRAT” can be seen on the covers of IN TRANCE as well as FIRE WIND. Uli played this guitar in EVERY SINGLE Scorpions concert since 1975 and on every single Electric Sun album !!!To make the evening even more intense, another VERY SPECIAL TREAT is reserved for the purchasers of VIP PASSES and comes as a big surprise. (VIP passes are only available online at UliJonRoth.com). VIP PASS holders will be given a unique opportunity to hear Uli perform his METAMORPHOSIS OF VIVALDI’S FOUR SEASONS in its entirety during a private pre-show concert !!!Uli has not performed Vivaldi’s Four Seasons in over 14 years and this is a very rare chance to hear this amazing piece of music played live by the “Master of the Sky Guitar” himself. Uli was the first and only guitarist ever to perform this most famous of all violin concertos on electric guitar note for note, stretching the instrument to the very limits of its capabilities, and beyond. Vivaldi’s Four Seasons concerto was written in 1723 and sounds as fresh and inspirational now as it did 300 years ago. Particularly so in Uli’s truly mind-blowing rendition, which is fiendishly difficult to play on guitar and can only be performed at concert pitch on one of his signature SKY GUITARS.Uli will be accompanied for the VIP event by his two very talented young protégés NIKLAS TURMAN and DAVID KLOSINSKI on guitar as well as CORVIN BAHN on keyboards who will play the orchestral parts. As an additional treat, Uli is going to perform this piece on his legendary “MIGHTY WING” 7-string SKY GUITAR, which has not been seen in public for a long time, but which was his main guitar for a period of 20 years.ULI JON ROTH FANS all over the world !

Those seeking an introduction to editing should consider taking VIVO’s beginner workshops, such as Intro to Adobe Premiere or Intro to Final Cut Pro X.This multi-day workshop is designed for students who want to advance beyond the basics and become more skilled in telling their stories. Each session explores editing theory through hands-on studio practice, allowing you to discover the nuanced relation between sound and image. Learn how various traditions, dominant styles, or popular forms inform how you might edit a scene; how multiple shots of the same scene can be pieced together for different effect; how editing conventions vary across formats and genres, including:- news- drama- experimental- action sequences- dialogue scenesUsing Final Cut Pro X as a guide, you will learn how to create a workflow for your projects; apply proper cuts, transitions, and effects; and choose delivery options. Hands-on camera exercises will deepen your understanding of how to shoot with editing in mind–a vital piece of the creative puzzle. Some time will be spent exploring sound mixing (though check out the upcoming VIVO workshop entirely devoted just sound mixing). Through group discussion and analysis of examples, you’ll explore different editing styles and techniques as you develop your own.By the end of the workshop, you will have edited a few scenes demonstrating what you’ve learned, and will have the conceptual toolkit to draw inspiration from movies you watch._______________Instructor bioFlick Harrison (flickharrison.com) is a writer, media artist, filmmaker, hacker and drone pilot in Vancouver. “I’ve explored boundaries of all kinds in media, politics, education and the arts for over twenty years. As an artist, I explode the aesthetics of political conflict; as an educator, I try to make media flow organically from the social.

It’s an audio experience like no other: re-enactment, internal monologue, evocative aural textures and more.What does it mean for a mind to be injured? The answer lurks beyond the objective world, behind a wall of privacy and selfhood. Here is your chance to jump over that wall, and feel a kind of empathy you may have thought impossible.

The gadgets chime, tap, click and shuffle while the humans move and speak in response. As they lock and shift, the dancers seem driven, almost desperate: the rhythm controls them. This is a triumph of engineering and a work of precision; the design of the instruments, the rigour of the dances and the music itself show a delicate, almost precarious intricacy.For all the mechanical sophistication on display, however, there’s something low-tech, even artisanal, about this show. The instruments are programmed down to the last hit, but their sounds are so palpably organic they can almost be felt as well as heard. Joining touch, sound and motion, MEETING calls on our primal impulses even as it dazzles with its sophistication.

The beloved Canadian classic about love, loss, and reconciliation is daringly re-imagined by visionary director Ravi Jain. With its boldly spare staging, this production asks \"Can you ever truly return home?\"It's 1926 and every day the villages of Newfoundland are being abandoned by their young for a new life in the big city; but, eighteen-year-old, Jacob Mercer, has come home to Coley's Point to win back his former sweetheart, Mary Snow, after abruptly leaving over a year ago. By the light of a moon-filled night, the former lovers meet to confront their past choices and contemplate a possible future together.“Ravi Jain is one of Canada’s bright lights,” says Artistic Director Jovanni Sy. “I am delighted to showcase this extraordinary director’s work here at Gateway. Ravi has taken one of the great plays from the Canadian canon and interpreted it into something that pays homage to its past and yet feels exactly right for today.”* AFTERNOON SHOWS AVAILABLE* Package options available - Tickets for all 4 Mainstage shows, or for all 6 season shows.* Subscribe and save up to 18%","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.167321,"lng":-123.147103},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.1686699802915,"lng":-123.1457540197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.1659720197085,"lng":-123.1484519802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"6500 Gilbert Rd, Richmond, BC V7C 3V4, Canada"},{"id":"1013671","tags":["Theatre"],"name":"Little Orange Man","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/little_orange_man_-_company_snafu_-_performer_ingrid_hansen_-_photo_by_al_smith_cropped.jpg?itok=-4EdlTFl","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/little_orange_man_-_company_snafu_-_performer_ingrid_hansen_-_photo_by_al_smith_cropped.jpg?itok=-YX60n_B"],"endDate":"2018-02-24T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-22T20:00:00-08:00","description":"LITTLE ORANGE MANfrom SNAFUPrepare yourself for Kitt the Kinder-Whisperer!

Ivan's message is that the possibility of the full awakening here and now for everybody, is not just a mere idea, but a divine fact, imbedded in our consciousness, regardless of our background, practice or personal conditions; it is always within us.Ivan Rados is a meditation master who was born in Former Yugoslavia. At the age of 42 he experienced a profound inner awakening that changed his perception of himself and the reality, after which Ivan was devoted to integrate his knowing into his being, marking the beginning of a movement towards the inner point, which he calls The Middle Point.Ivan is not associated with any particular spiritual movement, religion or tradition.

Alasdair Fraser, acclaimed by the San Francisco Examiner as “the Michael Jordan of Scottish fiddling,” has a concert and recording career spanning 30 years, with a long list of awards, accolades, television credits, and feature performances on top movie soundtracks (Last of the Mohicans,Titanic, Stone of Destiny). Fraser has been sponsored by the British Council to represent Scotland’s music internationally, and received the Scottish Heritage Center Service Award for outstanding contributions to Scottish culture and traditions. Natalie Haas, a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music, wasn’t even born when Alasdair was winning national fiddle competitions on the other side of the Atlantic. But this seemingly unlikely pairing is the fulfillment of a long-standing musical dream for Fraser, whose cutting-edge musical explorations took him full circle to find a cellist who could help him return the cello to its historical role at the rhythmic heart of Scottish dance music.Advance tickets available at roguefolk.bc.ca, Highlife Records, and Tapestry Music Vancouver.There will be an INSTRUCTIONAL WORKSHOP led by Alasdair and Natalie on the day of the performance, open to all players of all instruments.

The kids describe the future as they imagine it; they then arrive to talk with their listener in person. The cycle repeats itself, with the speakers casting further into the future each time. In the end, listeners are left alone to gaze and contemplate.What will happen to Vancouver? What does the future hold for our youth? These questions have taken on a particular urgency in our time of rampant construction and looming environmental crisis.

YOU WANT TO FREE YOUR BODY AND OPEN YOUR HEART…?ONTOGONIC SEXUAL ENERGY 5-Day Intensive you can expect to:• Explore the richness and depths of Ontogony Body-Mind Therapy at the physical, energetic, and transpersonal levels of your being;• Understand how Ontogonic Therapy approaches the body as a container which holds the unconscious experience;• Learn how therapy works to open the heart and establish healthy contact with ourselves and with the world;• Discover how deepening our awareness becomes a tool for transforming neurosis;• Experience how, by releasing muscular tension and integrating the unconscious into conscious awareness, we open our internal flow of energy.Ontogony is a therapeutic approach addressing the humanistic, transpersonal and holistic aspects of the individual: Energy, Body, Emotion, Mind and Spirit. This 5-day intensive offers an immersion experience in the Ontogonic Body-Mind Process, focused on unblocking Sexual Energy. Guided by Dr. Carlos de León and supported by a dynamic group environment, each participant works with his or her individual history with a goal of releasing limitations, connecting to a deeper wisdom, and creating a renewed sense of lightness, clarity and freedom.In Wilhelm Reich’s vision of sexuality, neuroses imply the existence of what he calls Character Armour: a system of muscular tensions developed as a defense against the breakthrough of emotions, especially anxiety, rage and sexual excitation. This armour functions to “protect“ us against the pain of the Unexpressed or the Socially Unacceptable.Because, through social repression, we have learned to associate feelings of expansion, joy and pleasure with the pain of rejection, shame and/or guilt, we learn to shut down by holding the breath, tensing muscles that would animate the impulse, and going numb. Ultimately, this physical constriction blocks contact to a point where sensations of increased excitement tend to trigger fear and tension rather than pleasure and letting go.By contrast, Reich offers the term Orgasmic Potency: the ability to surrender to the sexual flow without block or inhibition. Reich held that full, healthy orgasm is only reached when partners who love each other can express that love AND when both partners are sufficiently free of armour – at least as regards the moment of union – that they can experience the involuntary muscular movements before climax that open the breathing and the pleasure.In the Ontogonic Therapy approach, we work to unblock the body, liberating it from the impacts of earlier trauma and bringing awareness and acceptance to our personal histories. Freeing the energy flow supports orgasmic potency and, beyond that, supports a general experience of pleasure in life.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.26404369999999,"lng":-123.1655098},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.26539268029149,"lng":-123.1641608197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.26269471970849,"lng":-123.1668587802915}},"location_type":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED"},"formatted_address":"2667 W Broadway, Vancouver, BC V6K, Canada"},{"id":"1013906","tags":["Attractions","Fundraisers & Charity"],"name":"Exotic Reptile Show","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/exotic_reptile_show_3.jpg?itok=E7iUkkPw","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/exotic_reptile_show_3.jpg?itok=mKv1sSHz"],"endDate":"2018-03-11T16:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-03-10T11:00:00-08:00","description":"Meet snakes, lizards, and geckos at this show presented by the West Coast Society for the Protection and Conservation of Reptiles.

Written by David Greig, The Events features Claire, a priest and choir leader who has survived a mass shooting. Shattered and bereft, she looks for answers that may lead to some kind of affirmation of hope and faith. In this soul-searching work, the presence of the choir represents the most beautiful aspects of our shared humanity.Pi draws on community choirs from the Metro Vancouver area for participation; each performance, a different choral group shares the stage with the show’s two actors. This work of art about a community torn apart is an act of community engagement, prompting discussion as well as catharsis. In its compassion, its inclusivity and its spirit of inquiry, The Events is an act of resistance—an act of love."},{"id":"1007291","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Beth Ditto","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/12/bethditto_171213.jpg?itok=_a_3yLBg","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/12/bethditto_171213.jpg?itok=W5LxMoev"],"endDate":"2018-03-28T20:00:00-07:00","startDate":"2018-03-28T20:00:00-07:00","description":"American indie-rock singer-songwriter tours in support of debut studio albumFake Sugar.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.281962,"lng":-123.0998865},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2833109802915,"lng":-123.0985375197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2806130197085,"lng":-123.1012354802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"319 Main St, Vancouver, BC V6A 2T7, Canada"},{"id":"989861","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Big Wreck","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/11/bigwreck_171102.jpg?itok=p_4PHts3","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/11/bigwreck_171102.jpg?itok=4V31MFt7"],"endDate":"2018-03-02T21:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-03-01T21:00:00-08:00","description":"As part of the Straight Series, the Canadian rock band performs of its In Loving Memory of 20th Anniversary Tour.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2805555,"lng":-123.1207453},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28190448029149,"lng":-123.1193963197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2792065197085,"lng":-123.1220942802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"868 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1K3, Canada"},{"id":"985511","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Brockhampton","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/10/brockhampton_171024.jpg?itok=Te8BGqU7","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/10/brockhampton_171024.jpg?itok=smDZR_Da"],"endDate":"2018-02-26T21:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-26T21:00:00-08:00","description":"American hip-hop collective performs on its Love Your Parents Tour.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2799674,"lng":-123.1213742},"southwest":{"lat":49.27960290000001,"lng":-123.1219356}},"location":{"lat":49.2797851,"lng":-123.1216549},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2811341302915,"lng":-123.1203059197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2784361697085,"lng":-123.1230038802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"918 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1L2, Canada"},{"id":"1016976","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"The Segues","endDate":"2018-02-16T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-16T20:00:00-08:00","description":"The Live Agency + Live Acts presents:The Segues with special guests The Escapes, Gabe &amp; The Oh Yeahs and Stephen Ford Group.The Segues (Vancouver) // https://segues.bandcamp.com/The Segues are a dynamic three-piece band from Vancouver playing rock music with indie, surf, and grunge influences.

Converted for this production to a studio theatre, these upstairs rooms once hosted exclusive parties and performances by music legends like Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Sammy Davis Jr, and Frank Sinatra.A Steady Rain: With dark themes, sharp storytelling and biting repartee, A Steady Rain explores the complexities of a lifelong bond tainted by domestic affairs, violence, and the rough streets of Chicago. Joey and Denny have been best friends since kindergarten, and after working together for several years as policemen, they are practically family: Joey helps out with Denny's wife and kids; Denny keeps Joey away from the bottle. But when a domestic disturbance call takes a turn for the worse, their friendship is put on the line.Keith Huff is a resident playwright at Chicago Dramatists and the author of numerous plays that have been produced off Broadway and internationally. He was a Writer/Co-Producer for AMC's Emmy- and Golden Globe Award-winning series Mad Men, for which he won a 2011 Writers Guild Award (Best Drama Series). He is also a Writer/Producer for the NetFlix series House of Cards.

To become a professional at what you do you need to have a strong grasp of the rules of your trade. You can learn a lot from the school of hard knocks, but we’d like to offer you a much easier, faster, and less agonizing path; practical hands-on foundational training.While “foundational training” may not sound like the most exciting thing to spend your time on, it is very difficult to be creative when you struggle with composition or brushwork. Have you ever spent hours pushing paint around your canvas without understanding why your painting just isn’t working? Stop wasting your time and making yourself frustrated. Once you get your foundations down you can get back to enjoying your creative process, you can truly develop your skills, and begin to build a solid artistic career if that is something you desire. This foundational work is necessary if you want to be good at what you do.The Foundations Progam is a series of 10 classes, each focusing on 10 different fundemental concepts and taught by 10 different instructors, which aims to provide an introductory, high-level overview of what every artist should know. Each of these instructors are wonderful artists in their own right and also have at least a decade, often two decades or more of teaching experience. We’ve lined up a different instructor for each evening so you can benefit from their collective wisdom, all of whom have collaborated with each other to bring you a cohesive and progressive foundational program.Class ScheduleWeek 1 - Elements of Design: The Tools to Make ArtInstructor: Jan Crawford, AFCAWeek 2 - Principles of Design: How to Use the Tools to Make ArtInstructor: Lalita Hamill, AFCAWeek 3 - Drawing for Painting: The Art of SeeingInstructor: Mark AnthonyWeek 4 - Painting as an Extension of DrawingInstructor: Rick McDiarmid, SFCAWeek 5 - Tonal ValuesInstructor: Alan Wylie, SFCAWeek 6 - Colour Theory &amp; MixingInstructor: Gaye Adams, SFCAWeek 7 - BrushworkInstructor: Paul ChizikWeek 8 - Backgrounds, Layering &amp; GlazingInstructor: Janice Robertson, SFCAWeek 9 - Visual Reference SourcesInstructor: Liza VisagieWeek 10 - Inspiration, Creativity, Expression, NarrativeInstructor: Suzanne Northcott*Corresponding weekend workshops that will expand on each topic will be open for registration in Fall 2018.

The stand ups, who have honed their jokes until they are perfect, come to the Bloodfeud stage to show you what meticulous hard work and dedication can do.In the second half, a group of happy-go-lucky and \"uppity\" improvisers, representing the major Improv hubs of Vancouver, and having done nothing to prepare for the night, hit the stage.

In the end, listeners are left alone to gaze and contemplate.What will happen to Vancouver? What does the future hold for our youth? These questions have taken on a particular urgency in our time of rampant construction and looming environmental crisis.

This is something similar to hearing the music of Thorwind.After almost two decades of providing visceral and infectious foundations for many bands as a freelance drummer, singer songwriter Adam Parent has revealed a new side of his musical dice.With influences ranging from Gnarls Barkley, The Dead Weather, Half Moon Run and Thurston Moore, the result is something disparate and delicate, coaxing the listener into the unfamiliar.https://thorwind.bandcamp.comhttps://www.facebook.com/thorwindmusichttps://www.instagram.com/thorwindZACH KLEISINGERIn 2014, Moose Jaw native Zach Kleisinger took out his walking shoes and journeyed across the country playing street corners, bars, coﬀee shops, and venues - whoever would take in the determined, travelling poet. Zach landed in Victoria, B.C. to work with old friend Sam Weber, who produced his debut EP, “Between Cities”. The songs released on the EP captures an honest authenticity with a youthful curiosity. His brooding tales, gravelly vocals, and meandering guitar reflect the folk-fused blues of Bob Dylan, the earnest optimism of Jack Johnson, and the sonic style of Bruce Springsteen.The upcoming year will see him release his follow up EP, tour the west coast to continue building a faithful fan base, hitting small grassroots festivals, and taking his position in Canada’s folk landscape as a voice to be reckoned with.http://www.zachkleisinger.comhttps://www.facebook.com/zach.kleisingerhttps://www.instagram.com/zachkleisingerhttps://kleisingermusic.bandcamp.comWESLEY ATTEWWesley Attew is an English singer/songwriter now based in Vancouver, Canada.

In the end, listeners are left alone to gaze and contemplate.What will happen to Vancouver? What does the future hold for our youth? These questions have taken on a particular urgency in our time of rampant construction and looming environmental crisis.

Alpine environments around the world have changed dramatically over the last century. The most obvious changes have been to glaciers; in many areas glacier cover is less than 60% of what it was 150 years ago. Many glaciers may even vanish within the next several decades if current trends continue. Evidence from around the world shows that glaciers have advanced and retreated repeatedly during the last 10,000 years. However, the large and rapid recession of most glaciers in just over one century is unprecedented. As glaciers recede and, in some cases, disappear, stream flow will decrease, affecting fish populations, water supply, power generation, irrigation and tourism.The KPU-Science World Speaker Series is a partnership developed between KPU and Science World that supports the expansion of science in our communities. Join us for our third season of talks that work to engage, entertain and educate guests with fascinating insights into the world of science.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2733626,"lng":-123.1038728},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2747115802915,"lng":-123.1025238197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2720136197085,"lng":-123.1052217802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1455 Quebec St, Vancouver, BC V6A 3Z7, Canada"},{"id":"1014541","tags":["Film"],"name":"All the President&#039;s Men","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/allthepresidentsmen_180105.jpg?itok=ahpHfEyK","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/allthepresidentsmen_180105.jpg?itok=zlTp2eXX"],"endDate":"2018-01-21T19:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-21T19:00:00-08:00","description":"Alan J Pakula's film is an account ofWashington Postreporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s investigation into the Watergate break-in, which eventually led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2772038,"lng":-123.1246316},"southwest":{"lat":49.2768916,"lng":-123.1251891}},"location":{"lat":49.2770477,"lng":-123.1249104},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2783966802915,"lng":-123.1235613697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2756987197085,"lng":-123.1262593302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1181 Seymour St, Vancouver, BC V6B 3N3, Canada"},{"id":"1010616","tags":["Galleries","Museums"],"name":"Coast Salish Wool Weaving","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/12/screen_shot_2017-12-15_at_4.07.42_pm.png?itok=7CYkzw0J","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/12/screen_shot_2017-12-15_at_4.07.42_pm.png?itok=JsdLLDGL"],"endDate":"2018-01-20T16:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-20T10:00:00-08:00","description":"Join master weaver Jessica Silvey for a one-day wool weaving workshop and learn about the cultural significance and history of Coast Salish weaving.

Cherisse studies deep seafloor habitats in potential Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the Pacific Ocean. To meet national and international conservation goals, Canada is creating its largest Marine Protected Area or MPA to date, ~140,000 km2 of the Pacific offshore. The region’s seismic and geologic activity has created a diverse and complex seafloor. These natural networks of ecosystems support enhanced marine biodiversity, as well as ecologically, commercially, and culturally significant species.

The survivor of a medically induced coma and acquired brain injury, creator Shannon Yee presents a chance for us to live through her medical journey. In this radically immersive production, audience members lie on hospital beds, put on headphones and enter her mind. It’s an audio experience like no other: re-enactment, internal monologue, evocative aural textures and more.What does it mean for a mind to be injured? The answer lurks beyond the objective world, behind a wall of privacy and selfhood. Here is your chance to jump over that wall, and feel a kind of empathy you may have thought impossible. Along with its psychedelic frenzy and rushes of emotion, this work is perhaps most valuable for its tender intimacy."},{"id":"992351","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"The Wombats","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/11/thewombats_171108.jpg?itok=cQQ2R-ZS","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/11/thewombats_171108.jpg?itok=hVYyYEMr"],"endDate":"2018-01-30T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-30T20:00:00-08:00","description":"English rock band performs on its Beautiful People Will Ruin Your Life Tour 2018, with guests Blaenavon and Future Feats.","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2808842,"lng":-123.1211847},"southwest":{"lat":49.2805561,"lng":-123.1216889}},"location":{"lat":49.2807202,"lng":-123.1214368},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2820691302915,"lng":-123.1200878197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2793711697085,"lng":-123.1227857802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"881 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1L1, Canada"},{"id":"987881","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Wallows","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/10/wallows_171030.jpg?itok=iF2RFVBw","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/10/wallows_171030.jpg?itok=_yX44w7o"],"endDate":"2018-01-27T19:30:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-27T19:30:00-08:00","description":"Los Angeles-based alt-rock band performs on its North American Winter Tour.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2621803,"lng":-123.0704502},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.26352928029149,"lng":-123.0691012197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.26083131970849,"lng":-123.0717991802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1660 E Broadway, Vancouver, BC V5N 1W1, Canada"},{"id":"963201","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Hippo Campus","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/09/hippocampus_170912.jpg?itok=XHvjX4qo","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/09/hippocampus_170912.jpg?itok=q1c-BVk1"],"endDate":"2018-01-18T21:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-18T21:00:00-08:00","description":"American rock band tours in support of latest EP releasewarm glow, with guests Sure Sure.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.281962,"lng":-123.0998865},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2833109802915,"lng":-123.0985375197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2806130197085,"lng":-123.1012354802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"319 Main St, Vancouver, BC V6A 2T7, Canada"},{"id":"1013381","tags":["Concerts","Food & Drink"],"name":"The Kendall Goddard Band + Emma Citrine + Gavin Harper","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/img_20180103_034911_049.jpg?itok=exTpaZQP","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/img_20180103_034911_049.jpg?itok=F6Zfs46d"],"endDate":"2018-01-28T23:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-28T19:30:00-08:00","description":"*Sunday Jan 28*The Kendall Goddard Band + Emma Citrine + Gavin HarperThe Kendall Goddard Band - Acoustic/Folk/Country/Pop offerings and harmonic story-telling at its best.http://kendallgoddard.comhttps://m.facebook.com/NamasteAnge","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.28302739999999,"lng":-123.0962677},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2843763802915,"lng":-123.0949187197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2816784197085,"lng":-123.0976166802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"362 Powell St, Vancouver, BC V6A 1G4, Canada"},{"id":"1016866","tags":["Forums & Talks"],"name":"SFU Philosophers&#039; Cafe","endDate":"2018-01-30T18:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-30T18:00:00-08:00","description":"What are some things you need to stop wasting your time on?

Russell Earl Marsland and LOVESTRUCK pays respect to the life of SRV through his classics such as “Cold Shot”, “Pride &amp; Joy”, “Couldn’t Stand the Weather”, “The House is Rockin’”, and of course, “Love Struck Baby”Vocalist and guitar virtuoso Russell Earl Marsland has been a powerful presence in the Vancouver music scene for more than 30 years.

Russell has performed with hundreds of artists, and has shared the stage with the Allman Brothers, BB King, Chuck Berry, James Brown, Ray Charles, and Steppenwolf, to name a few. Joining Russell is an all-star band consisting of Kerry Galloway (Bass), Kyle Randomsky (Drums) and Chris Gestrin (Hammond Organ).Russell and SRV both had much love and respect for Jimi Hendrix, BB King, Albert Collins, Albert King along with Wes Montgomery, Dick Dale and many other guitar greats!","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.02628199999999,"lng":-122.800763},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.0276309802915,"lng":-122.7994140197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.0249330197085,"lng":-122.8021119802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1328 Johnston Rd, White Rock, BC V4B 3Z2, Canada"},{"id":"1010816","tags":["Concerts","Fundraisers & Charity"],"name":"Voices of the Pacific Rim","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/12/chung_hannah_1.jpg?itok=-NiulGjf","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/12/chung_hannah_1.jpg?itok=oYt7lPGC"],"endDate":"2018-01-23T19:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-23T19:00:00-08:00","description":"An evening of opera with a twistVancouver Opera’s 2018 Voices of the Pacific Rim recital is an exclusive fundraising event that will celebrate and feature world–renowned artists from China, Japan, Korea, Canada and the United States.

Gurney at The Tsawwassen Arts Centre, January 18 to February 3, 2018. The Fighting Days by Wendy Lill was the scheduled production for this time, but due to production constraints, Sidekick has had to postpone this play until next season.Love Letters, directed by Carroll Lefebvre and starring Marcia Strang and Jeff Pannell is the story of Andrew Makepeace Ladd III and Melissa Gardner, both born to wealth and position, are childhood friends whole lifelong correspondence begins with birthday party thank-you notes and summer camp postcards. Romantically attached, they continue to exchange letters through the boarding school and college years. Where Andy goes on to excel at Yale and Law schools, while Melissa flunks out of a series of \"good schools\". While Andy is off at war Melissa marries, but her attachment to Andy remains strong and she continues to keep in touch as he marries, becomes a successful attorney, gets involved in politics and, eventually, is elected to the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, her marriage in tatters, Melissa dabbles in art and gigolos, drinks more than she should, and becomes estranged from her children. Andy's last letter makes it eloquently clear how much they really meant, and gave to, each other over the years...physically apart, perhaps, but spiritually as close as only true lovers can be.Love Letters is a different theatre experience and has been produced all over the world including Broadway and London. It opened with Kathleen Turner and John Rubinstein on March 27, 1989, and has been produced with many celebrities including Larry Hagman reunited with his Dallas co-star Linda Gray for a tour with Love Letters. Later, in 2006, Hagman performed in the play five times in New York and Florida with his I Dream of Jeannie co-star Barbara Eden. Shortly before his death in 1992, Robert Reed appeared in the touring production of Love Letters, opposite Betsy Palmer. On Valentine's Day 1992, Charlton Heston and his wife Lydia Clarke performed the play at the Hershey Theater in Hershey, Pennsylvania. In the mid 1990s, the play toured with Robert Wagner and Jill St. John. However, before performing with his wife, Jill St. John, Wagner acted with his Hart to Hart co-star Stefanie Powers beginning in Boston in 1988. Together they did more than 350 performances and were the first to bring the play to the Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End. On July 17, 1993, Carol Burnett, Brian Dennehy, Mel Gibson, and Sissy Spacek performed the play at the Sheridan Opera House in Telluride, Colorado.In early 1995, Lynn Redgrave and John Clark, at the invitation of Judge Lance Ito, performed the play for the sequestered jury on their day off, in the same courtroom where the O.J. Simpson trial. On December 1, 2007, Elizabeth Taylor and James Earl Jones gave a benefit performance of the play, directed by John Tillinger, to raise one million dollars for Taylor's AIDS foundation. Tickets for the show were priced at $2,500 and more than 500 people attended. The event happened to coincide with the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike and, rather than cross the picket line, Taylor requested a \"one night dispensation\". The Writers Guild agreed not to picket the Paramount Pictures lot that night, to allow for the performance. The play returned to Broadway on September 13, 2014 to the Brooks Atkinson Theater in limited engagements with rotating casts. The first cast starred Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow, followed by Carol Burnett with Dennehy, and Alan Alda and Candice Bergen; scheduled next were Anjelica Huston, Stacy Keach, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen. This production closed early, after 6 previews and 95 performances, ending with the cast of Alan Alda and Candice Bergen on December 14, 2014.On November 10, 2016, Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks performed \"Love Letters\" at Stanford University for a fundraiser for the arts.Marcia Strang has graced the Sidekick stage several times beginning with I'll Be Back Before Midnight then The Melville Boys, Waiting for the Parade, The Laramie Project, Les Belles Soeurs and as the delightful Anita in Jenny's House of Joy. Jeff Pannell has also appeared in Faith County, An Evening of Culture, The Laramie Project, Maggie's Getting Married, On Golden Pond, The Secret Mask, Mending Fences and the sinister Roat in Wait Until Dark.Performances are Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings at 8 pm and two matinees on Sunday, January 21 &amp; 28 at 2 pm.

SHIT asks us to consider women with foul mouths and weathered faces, women who spit, fight, swear, hurt and steal; and Billy, Bobby, and Sam – angry, unrelenting, terrifying, damaged women – answer. They discuss fist fights, foster care, babies, their mothers, crying, and what it’s like to believe in absolutely nothing.“There is nothing romantic in these characters’ outsider mindsets,” says Cornelius. “There is something really admirable about the fight in them, about the struggle to not succumb to whatever everyone thinks they should be or how they should behave. I think women in particular relate to that. I never want to write a moment in a play where a woman succumbs to coquettishness or is sexualized in any way, or has to be grateful or apologetic, or is there to serve some male protagonist. For women, being grateful all the time is exhausting.”A tragic and uncompromising, yet unexpectedly funny production, SHIT is directed by the Firehall Arts Centre’s Donna Spencer and features performances by Yoshié Bancroft (Japanese Problem), Sharon Crandall (Satellites), and Kayla Deorksen (Green Lake).“When I saw this work at the Sydney Festival and then had the opportunity to meet Patricia, I knew immediately this was a play that the Firehall should stage,” says Spencer. “It is hard-hitting, political, heart-wrenching, and mind-bending. I am pleased to be directing this work and to have the opportunity to work with three of Vancouver’s finest young actors.\"Credits for SHIT:Written by: Patricia CorneliusDirected by: Donna SpencerPerformances by: Yoshié Bancroft, Sharon Crandall, &amp; Kayla DeorksenSet Design by: Conor MooreLighting Design by: Kyla GardinerStage Management by: Susan D.

In their collaborative multidisciplinary practice, Ibghy and Lemmens investigate the material, affective and sensory dimensions of experience, and the ways in which the logic of economy infiltrates the most intimate aspects of our lives.This project extends from a publication by the artists related to work, productivity and idleness. It is structured around Diderot’s Rameau’s Nephew (a satirical late 18th century text) which presents a dialogue between a philosopher and a vagabond that offers two opposing views on work: the philosopher loves unconfined thought, while the vagabond is an idler, buffoon, actor, and musician who avoids sites of production. Diderot’s text provides an alternate view within the Enlightenment, a period often portrayed as the foundation of our contemporary obsession with productivity.SFU students will workshop and interpret the publication through improvisational performances during the course of the project. The performers will inhabit the character of Rameau’s nephew (the vagabond) and their performances will be sporadic so that visitors to the gallery may or may not witness a performance, and may or may not be aware that what they are witnessing is a performance. When the Guests Are Not Looking addresses the social demand for individuals to perform within the conditions of post-Fordist labour regimes and neoliberal social processes, and for the gallery to similarly “perform” within these circumstances.Based in Durham-Sud, Quebec, Ibghy and Lemmens have shown their work extensively nationally and internationally.Curated by Melanie O’BrianRelated eventsOpening Reception and Artist TalkSAT, JAN 20 / 3 - 5PMAudain GalleryExhibition TourSAT, FEB 3 / 1PMPart of the Downtown Vancouver Gallery TourPanel Conversation: Performing IntertextualityWED, FEB 28 / 7PMAudain Gallery","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2824817,"lng":-123.108192},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2838306802915,"lng":-123.1068430197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2811327197085,"lng":-123.1095409802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"149 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 1H4, Canada"},{"id":"1008996","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Black Boys","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/12/promo-image-by-tanja-tiziana_1200px.jpg?itok=qbmQI0rK","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/12/promo-image-by-tanja-tiziana_1200px.jpg?itok=V7xHELiR"],"endDate":"2018-01-20T22:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-16T20:00:00-08:00","description":"The Cultch presents, a Buddies in Bad Times/Saga Collectif (Toronto) production, in association with Zee Zee Theatre.A raw, intimate, and timely exploration of queer male Blackness.

Written by David Greig, The Events features Claire, a priest and choir leader who has survived a mass shooting. Shattered and bereft, she looks for answers that may lead to some kind of affirmation of hope and faith. In this soul-searching work, the presence of the choir represents the most beautiful aspects of our shared humanity.Pi draws on community choirs from the Metro Vancouver area for participation; each performance, a different choral group shares the stage with the show’s two actors. This work of art about a community torn apart is an act of community engagement, prompting discussion as well as catharsis. In its compassion, its inclusivity and its spirit of inquiry, The Events is an act of resistance—an act of love."},{"id":"996841","tags":["Concerts","Nightlife"],"name":"Red Fang","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/11/redfang_171128.jpg?itok=O2YaGika","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/11/redfang_171128.jpg?itok=lm4XAX6J"],"endDate":"2018-01-16T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-16T20:00:00-08:00","description":"Blueprint Live presents Portland stoner metal band Red Fang, on tour in support of their new album 'Only Ghosts'.

In 2012, members of the group collected over 100 discarded bicycle frames to build the instruments. The colorful metal scraps, configured into a series of metallophones instruments, created a platform for new experimentation with gamelan music on the West Coast. The ensemble has presented performances at the Western Front, the Surrey Art Gallery, the Vancouver Folk Music Festival and released Hi-Ten, a collection of original music with the Indonesia-based art collective and label Insitu Recordings on November 11, 2017.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZCrFW8j810JESSE WALDMANOne of Jesse Waldman’s most cherished possessions is a cassette of his grandmother singing the Yiddish folk song Papirosen to his mother. A remnant, like the abandoned guitar discovered in his parent’s basement, that drove his rock ‘n roll dreams out of the suburban sprawl of Thornhill, Ontario, and into the bars of downtown Toronto. A journey cross-country led him to mountains, ocean, and into the arms of Vancouver's Commercial Drive music scene. Now his home of over twenty years, the West Coast continues to inspire his lush imagery, sublime melodies, and outstanding technique.Influenced by folk and blues pioneers Townes Van Zandt, Taj Mahal, and Neil Young, Jesse has toured Canada, Western US, and the UK, performing everywhere from local pubs to soft-seat theaters, appearing at major festivals including Vancouver's Folk and International Jazz Fests and Burnaby Blues and Roots Fest.Mansion Full of Ghosts is Jesse's highly anticipated solo debut, an exploration of the city's vast duality, a backdrop of beauty mirrored by a fierce underbelly, and a need to keep a light on in the dark.https://youtu.be/HFrTFsYYlYQGENTLE PARTY“its ambitions are symphonic, and this incredibly assured debut delivers stunning, wide-screen sound.”-Alexander Varty (Georgia Straight)Gentle Party is an avant chamber pop ensemble that pioneers a unique, expansive sound distinct to the quartet’s West Coast roots. The hauntingly evocative voice of Jessicka rests on a bed of luscious strings from Meredith Bates (violin), Shanto Acharia (cello) and Elisa Thorn (harp). The music conjures images of pandemonium and playfulness contrasted with stark heartbreak.https://gentleparty.bandcamp.com/releasesMEGAN STEWARTIn The Future Show, a solo performer attempts to unveil her future, from the final moments of the performance to the final moments of her death.

Canada’s Ballet Jörgen brings back the magical tale of the Russian Grand Duchess Anastasia for the 100th anniversary of the story and the 10th anniversary of the production. Created by acclaimed choreographer and artistic director Bengt Jörgen, Anastasia is set to an original full orchestra score by Russian/Canadian composer Ivan Barbotin.The mystery of what happened to the 17-year-old Grand Duchess has fascinated people for nearly a century, spanning a multitude of books, movies and musicals. Anastasia is both the tragic story of an innocent girl and the subject of modern mythology, as there is great speculation about what actually happened that fateful summer of 1918. The human drama of a young girl born to privilege and cast out into a world of immense heartache proves an extraordinarily gripping tale. This ballet explores the emotions, aspirations, and affections of this lovable yet controversial character as the world transforms around her.Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, renowned for its ability to succinctly tell classical stories in an engaging and dramatic fashion, follows the daughter of the fallen Russian Tsar through the ballrooms of St. Petersburg, to the Russian Revolution, to captivity, and beyond…Click here to buy now or learn more: https://kaymeek.com/dance","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.33799,"lng":-123.160163},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.3393389802915,"lng":-123.1588140197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.3366410197085,"lng":-123.1615119802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1700 Mathers Ave, West Vancouver, BC V7V 2G7, Canada"},{"id":"1016816","tags":["Holiday","Other"],"name":"Greece Through the Ages info session","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/19-santorini.jpg?itok=5NY9eUIe","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/19-santorini.jpg?itok=t_urn6YX"],"endDate":"2018-01-15T19:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-15T19:00:00-08:00","description":"Learn about ancient and modern Greece and the upcoming cultural tour scheduled for May 2018.

Three actor writers - two Indigenous and one white - come together to create a play about the political conflicts surrounding Canada's oil industry, confronting their own prejudices and hypocrisies along the way.Premiering last year to rave reviews and sold out houses at the Gateway Theatre, The Pipeline Project is not only an investigation into the growing conflicts between BC First Nations and the fossil fuel industry, it is an evocative exploration of Reconciliation, environmentalism and first world privilege.The second act is a Talk Forward. Each night a different guest speaker will respond to the play and then participate in a facilitated conversation with the audience. Featured speakers include KAI NAGATA (Dogwood Initiative), AMIE WOLF, PHD (Aboriginal University Bridging Program at Vancouver Island University), and JENNY UECHI (Vancouver Observer).Firehall Arts Centre’s Artistic Producer, Donna Spencer, recommends the show, stating: “In 2015, The Pipeline Project was part of our BC Buds Spring Arts Festival. It was obvious then that when completed it would be an important work and one that we are pleased to bring to Firehall audiences, as we all must consider the impact of the petroleum industry on the health of the planet. “","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2820937,"lng":-123.0979146},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2834426802915,"lng":-123.0965656197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2807447197085,"lng":-123.0992635802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"280 E Cordova St, Vancouver, BC V6A 1L3, Canada"},{"id":"1004176","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"B3 For Bunny: New York’s Pat Bianchi Trio","endDate":"2018-02-09T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-08T20:00:00-08:00","description":"Two-time Grammy nominated organist and winner ofDownbeatmagazine's 2016 rising star poll, Pat Bianchi is known for his harmonic prowess, rhythmic intensity, and versatility that are rivalled by few.

He conjures up powerful maelstroms that birth sublime, fragile heads that are delicate,powerful, dominant, yet profoundly introspective. Heads of godforsaken Madonnas, carved of the opaque skyon devastated lands. Single heads, like islets of flesh.Khaled Alkhani has arduously tamed the unthinkable. He hunts in the far-flung margins ofcreativity; his realms of the flesh are bodies imbued with humanity. The flesh of destiny. They do not performfor an audience. They are pure, harsh brushwork, born of the clash of fluid movement and flamboyantcolour. They are vaporous bodily projections, sumptuous carnal calligraphy formed when the artistshamanistically liberates the energy quivering in the fathoms of an inner life. The heterogeneous, pluralisticbodies disinterred from the substratum of appearances are clothed in space.Khaled Alkhani’s searing abstract backdrops contrast with the heads that loom forth from thedepths. Their features dominate the earthly struggle; the customary cladding of human skin is foreverbeyond their reach. These are painting’s principal target, the sole survivors of countless catastrophes.Harsh, raw red dominates a palette of purples that violate the shadows, in striking contrast to thesubdued, softer matte tones that bring balm to the expanse of background. A grey horizon often presidesover the burial of all the colours of the world.Khaled Alkhani’s canvas breathes in harmony with the void. The dark side screams out for lifewhile maintaining the primaeval chaos of imprisonment in the body. Creative violence and serenity are locked in an embrace.This hectic art is contagious. It raises the rate of mental compression and in this face-to-face struggleto the death, there can be no escape. This art of extravagant fever and transgression topples visual inertia.Khaled Alkhani, an accomplished, avid black box of an artist, never merely illustrates. His vividoeuvre records at two speeds: the instant of impact in the surge of movements, hues, and instincts, andageless alluvial deposits of emotions forming a tracery of silted strata.The shattered, bruised bodies, victims of a world that deals in death, react by exorcising that whichshatters and kills in one ultimate act of rejection. Khaled Alkhani’s contemporary Expressionism banishesbad memories. His majestic art speaks of the infinity of life that resists infinitely: his painting is an expanseof bedazzlement.Christian Noorbergen, Art CriticTo learn more about the artist, contact Zohra Bonnis: +16043120991 | info@zgalleryarts.com","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2703517,"lng":-123.1426977},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2717006802915,"lng":-123.1413487197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2690027197085,"lng":-123.1440466802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"102-1688 W 1st Ave, Vancouver, BC V6J 1G1, Canada"},{"id":"1018566","tags":["Concerts","Nightlife"],"name":"Sammi Morelli","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/liveagency_sammimorelli_pstr-web.jpg?itok=YEWdSFRL","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/liveagency_sammimorelli_pstr-web.jpg?itok=e3KnC1Dj"],"endDate":"2018-01-19T20:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-19T20:00:00-08:00","description":"The Live Agency presents:Electrifying emerging pop artist Sammi Morelli with special guests Kaylan Mackinnon and Victoria Staff.SAMMI MORELLI (Kelowna) //https://www.sammimorellimusic.com/KAYLAN MACKINNON (Vancouver) // https://www.kaylanmackinnon.com/VICTORIA STAFF (Vancouver) // https://www.facebook.com/VictoriaStaff21/Doors: 8PM// 19+RAILWAY STAGE &amp; BEER CAFÉ579 Dunsmuir Streethttp://www.facebook.com/railwaySBChttp://www.twitter.com/railwaySBChttp://www.instagram.com/railwaySBCFor more information email railway@donnellygroup.ca.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2828958,"lng":-123.1150214},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2842447802915,"lng":-123.1136724197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2815468197085,"lng":-123.1163703802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"579 Dunsmuir St, Vancouver, BC V6B 3K4, Canada"},{"id":"1015411","tags":["Other"],"name":"Beginner Beekeeping Weekend Course","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/course.jpeg?itok=gUXRnLt7","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/course.jpeg?itok=_qI-fsVy"],"endDate":"2018-01-21T17:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-20T09:00:00-08:00","description":"The course is delivered in 8 modules, covering the core principles that support best practices in beekeeping.

The Royal Collection includes a large group of images of artists–both portraits and self-portraits–that offer keen insights into how artists see themselves and their position in society. Beginning with King Charles I, one of Europe’s greatest art collectors, succeeding British monarchs employed and collected the work of artists, both British and European. The growing respect for artists as creators led to the collecting of artist’s self-portraits and images of artists both at work and playing roles. The exhibition presents a diverse range of works by artist both historical and contemporary artists such as Julia Margaret Cameron, Annibale Carracci, Mary Knowles, Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud. Highlights include an extraordinary self-portrait by Sir Edwin Landseer, The Connoisseurs: Portrait of the Artist with Two Dogs, 1865, a sculpture by Sarah Bernhardt presenting herself as a mythological creature, A Self-Portrait as a Chimera, 1880, and one of the most important Italian paintings of the seventeenth century, Artemisia Gentileschi’s iconic, Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting (La Pittura), c. 1638-39. Through these works the exhibition traces the evolving role and importance of artists within society at large.The Royal Collection is one of most important collections of art in the world. Built over centuries by successive British monarchs and continued today by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the collection includes a remarkable range of objects and works of art. Central to the history of the monarchy has been the role of art, both to define the image of the monarch and to confirm their power, wealth and taste.This exhibition, which is exclusive to Vancouver, is presented by kind permission of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and helps mark the sesquicentennial of Canada.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2830077,"lng":-123.1208179},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28435668029149,"lng":-123.1194689197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2816587197085,"lng":-123.1221668802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"750 Hornby St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 2H7, Canada"},{"id":"1012926","tags":["Concerts"],"name":"Chris Jones and The Night Drivers","endDate":"2018-01-15T19:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-15T19:00:00-08:00","description":"The Pacific Bluegrass &amp; Heritage Society presents Nashville bluegrass band, Chris Jones &amp; the Night Drivers appear at the ANZA Club in concert.

Basically Queer answers those questions that many want to ask but fear will give offence —What is it really like to be queer? What’s appropriate language? How can I be an ally? It also provides a succinct and readable account of queer history and legal rights worldwide, addresses intergenerational issues, and offers some tips and tricks for living queer.“A wonderful, rare, much- needed conversation between intergenerational queer histories, imaginations, desires, anxieties and above all, hope. A reader, a teaching guide, a journey to the queer past and to the queer future, elders and youth, holding each other dear.”—Joan Nestle, writer, activist, educator, and co- founder of the NY Lesbian Herstory ArchivesRefreshments &amp; Entertainment by the Uku-looniesPeter Lang Publishing, Inc. | International Academic Publishers","geometry":{"bounds":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2770305,"lng":-123.0696572},"southwest":{"lat":49.276746,"lng":-123.0698551}},"location":{"lat":49.2768883,"lng":-123.0697561},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2782372302915,"lng":-123.0684071697085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2755392697085,"lng":-123.0711051302915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1739 Venables St, Vancouver, BC V5L 2H3, Canada"},{"id":"1004956","tags":["Other"],"name":"The Basics of Kundalini Yoga","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/17/12/semperviva_georgiastraight_eventheaders_jan_23_gloria.jpg?itok=P8s7mMh-","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/17/12/semperviva_georgiastraight_eventheaders_jan_23_gloria.jpg?itok=r3J1mkc-"],"endDate":"2018-01-28T17:30:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-01-23T06:00:00-08:00","description":"Kundalini Yoga is designed to create fast and lasting results.

Participants arrive at a location with a wide city vista. There, they listen to recordings from local children speaking as their older selves. The kids describe the future as they imagine it; they then arrive to talk with their listener in person. The cycle repeats itself, with the speakers casting further into the future each time. In the end, listeners are left alone to gaze and contemplate.What will happen to Vancouver? What does the future hold for our youth? These questions have taken on a particular urgency in our time of rampant construction and looming environmental crisis.

The duo began writing songs while living in Montreal, daydreaming of summer drives on the Sea to Sky highway. They are currently recording their debut album, Water’s Gate, a thematic collection of songs set for release in the Spring.

Access to energy has allowed us to do remarkable things. However, the energy we’ve shaped our lives around is dirty energy. To be modern is to live a contradiction. Energy use expands possibilities; those same possibilities are threatened by the environmental and social implications of the expanding use of energy. How can we make sense of this contradiction? A narrative of the 21st century told through five interconnected vignettes about art, literature, pipelines, justice and transitions.Imre Szeman teaches communication and cultural studies at the University of Waterloo. He conducts research on energy and environmental studies, critical and cultural theory, and social and political philosophy (especially 20th and 21st century left theory, globalization and nationalism). His most recent books include Contemporary Marxist Theory (co-ed, 2015), After Oil (co-author, 2016); Companion to Critical and Cultural Theory (co-ed, 2017), Energy Humanities: An Anthology (co-ed, 2017), Fueling Culture: 101 Words for Energy and Environment (co-ed, 2017) and Petrocultures: Oil, Politics and Culture (co-ed, 2017). On Petrocultures, a collection of his recent work, will be published in 2018. He is currently at work on At the Limit: Reckoning Energy Impasse, Forging Energy Transition and Energy Revolution, both for MIT Press.This Visual Art Forum is presented by the Audain Faculty of Art in partnership with Trading Routes and School of Communication and the Faculty of Communication, Art and Technology, Simon Fraser University.Free and open to all.

Although his recordings have gained consistent critical acclaim, he is best known for his scintillating live performances, each markedly different in form and content from the next.When Taylor Guitars crafted its Leo Kottke signature model, they described its namesake as follows:“More than any other artist, Leo Kottke has defined the role of the contemporary acoustic guitarist as self-styled virtuoso, amassing a worldwide following in the process. The self-taught guitarist first surfaced with his legendary 1969 recording, “Six and Twelve-String Guitar”. Since then he has blazed a singular stylistic path that continues to diverge from mainstream guitar music. Classical precision, pop attractiveness, jazz fluency, 20th-century harmony, bluesy fundamentalism, rubbery, syncopated rhythms, and lyrics that feature quasi-literary characterizations all vie for supremacy in his music and challenge preconceived notions of how acoustic guitar music should sound. In addition to his masterful musicianship, Kottke is beloved for a droll perspective on life that puts a tilt on his material and keeps concert audiences highly amused.” – Taylor Guitars","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.27226169999999,"lng":-123.1343217},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.2736106802915,"lng":-123.1329727197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2709127197085,"lng":-123.1356706802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"1585 Johnston St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3R9, Canada"},{"id":"1020996","tags":["Galleries","Literary/Books"],"name":"February First Thursday at The Fort Gallery","image":["//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_standard/public/events/18/01/susan_mccaslin.jpg?itok=YWJsuHCG","//d2ciprw05cjhos.cloudfront.net/files/v3/styles/gs_small/public/events/18/01/susan_mccaslin.jpg?itok=BERgRrry"],"endDate":"2018-02-01T21:00:00-08:00","startDate":"2018-02-01T19:00:00-08:00","description":"On the first Thursday of each month, The Fort Gallery hosts a variety of visual artists, musicians, writers and poets from the local community who share their gifts and creations. On February 1st, we are pleased to welcome Fort Langley poet Susan McCaslin.Susan will be reading and presenting from her new volume of selected poems, Into the Open: Poems New and Selected (Toronto: Inanna Publications, Oct. 2017), a compilation and synthesis of over four decades of the best of her poetry. The explorations of Into the Open begin with McCaslin's intense early interest in mystical Christianity, but expand to include global wisdom traditions from cultures east and west. Her work does not advocate for a particular system of belief, but exemplifies the open-ended probings of an inquiring mind. In the Fall of 2017, she toured with the book in Ontario, the lower mainland of BC, and gave readings in Edmonton. She is now delighted to be reading to aficionados of the arts in her “home town” of Fort Langley.Susan McCaslin, an established Canadian poet and Faculty Emeritus of English and Creative Writing at Douglas College, New Westminster, BC, has published fifteen volumes of poetry, including her most recent, Into the Open: Poems New and Selected (Inanna, Sept. 2017). Susan has also published a memoir, Into the Mystic: My Years with Olga (Inanna, 2014) and a volume of essays, Arousing the Spirit (Wood Lake, 2011). Her Demeter Goes Skydiving (University of Alberta Press, 2011) was short-listed for the Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize (BC Poetry Book Prize) and first-place winner of the Alberta Book Publishing Award. Susan resides in Fort Langley, BC, where she initiated the Han Shan Poetry Project as part of a successful campaign to protect an endangered rainforest along the Fraser River. Her Thomas Merton Superabundantly Alive, a work of creative non-fiction written in collaboration with J.S.

This is a very special event with Antonio Sánchez, one of the world’s greatest living drummers, accompanying the Oscar-winning film Birdman live. It’s peak virtuosity: an epic score for an epic film, performed in the flesh by its master creator. Sánchez’ tour-de-force performance, in all its percussive glory, has received applause across the globe: from L.A. to Sydney, São Paulo to Mexico City.Most of Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film unfolds as if in one continuous cinematic shot, and Sánchez’ score is the perfect complement— it rolls along to the action with a nervous energy, stretching out like a drumroll for the world’s longest high-wire act. The screen belongs to stars Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone, but Sánchez owns the stage, rolling out his beats in perfect time to the movie.

As the sun starts to set, a new world emerges, and our hero finds himself caught up in a frightening scenario. Danger lurks, and as the light fades things get stranger and stranger.The tools of the trade here are puppetry, animation, shadow play and live performance, and there’s joy in seeing how much the show’s creators can do with what they have. They know that with resourcefulness and the power of suggestion, a complete world can be evoked.

Participants arrive at a location with a wide city vista. There, they listen to recordings from local children speaking as their older selves. The kids describe the future as they imagine it; they then arrive to talk with their listener in person. The cycle repeats itself, with the speakers casting further into the future each time. In the end, listeners are left alone to gaze and contemplate.What will happen to Vancouver? What does the future hold for our youth? These questions have taken on a particular urgency in our time of rampant construction and looming environmental crisis. In this game of make-believe, the future is handed to those who will own it, and it lies over our city in the most beautiful form it can take: that of a child’s rich imagination."},{"id":"1020936","tags":["Galleries","Forums & Talks"]},{"id":"1017966","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Endings | Tamara Saulwick (Australia)","description":"Amidst a vast black space, a light traces the outlines of objects and bodies: an old-style record player, a reel-to-reel recorder, a singer and his guitar, and creator and performer Tamara Saulwick. Under these illuminations a sort of conjuring is being conducted; voices are heard as if from the beyond. In fact, they come from various interview recordings, and they’re cut together in a montage that serves as an homage to loved ones passed.With candour and warmth, these recorded voices speak about mortality and loss. To hear them is a deeply touching experience, not least because of the artistry with which they’re brought to the stage. Cut, warped and refracted through old technologies, the recordings form a richly textured sound-world from which myriad stories emerge. In this digital age, the analog elements are especially resonant, with voices emerging from the hiss and crackle of vinyl.

His three-octave range puts him at the peaks of highbrow culture, but he moves to popular styles without missing a beat. Reflective and insightful, his writing draws on personal experience and a level of erudition that belies his age.

Using dance, text, video, music and the power of plain old speech, Calderoni and company throw haymakers at the patriarchy.This is a performance in the truest sense of the word, contrasting the roles we’re given with those we’re free to choose for ourselves. The work of gender theorist Judith Butler looms large, as do the twin legacies of rock ‘n’ roll and DJ music. You could call this an intellectual dance party—it’s both visceral and theoretical, provoking contemplation and ecstasy in equal measure.

Danger lurks, and as the light fades things get stranger and stranger.The tools of the trade here are puppetry, animation, shadow play and live performance, and there’s joy in seeing how much the show’s creators can do with what they have. They know that with resourcefulness and the power of suggestion, a complete world can be evoked.

She’s created a meditation on her own menstrual cycle—an explosive mixture of the deeply personal and the fiercely political.Ashbee takes the body as her material for metaphor, and her work is one of startling dynamics. At one moment there is rhythm and repetition, at another complete darkness, and the line between beauty and agony becomes blurred.

Too often, emotional uplift and political subversion walk separate paths in the arts; but in these days of resurgent authoritarianism, the impulses need to be united. On that score, Rzewski’s composition is perfect: it lifts the spirit without letting it off the hook.Protest songs from around the world are gathered together, as if at one large rally. They include “Soldiers of the Moor,” written by concentration camp inmates, and the beautiful American civil rights anthem “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.” Rzewski and Vandewalle take these works as points of departure, transforming them without for a moment betraying their moral or historical meaning.

There’s so much to enjoy here: the multimedia excess, the virtuosity of famed pianist Vicky Chow and, most refreshingly, the unabashed intellectualism of the project. This is avant-garde radicalism that plays like a video game: dynamic, exuberant and visually arresting."},{"id":"1017941","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"I&#039;m Not Here | THEATREclub (Ireland)","description":"Doireann has a show for us.

There’s a story she wants to tell, of an encounter she once had in a foreign country. Walking by a canal one day, she saw a man throwing stones at a duck and wound up in a nasty confrontation with him. The experience stayed with her, and grew into an idea for a show about morality, culture and the politics of intervention.A furious thinker and a born entertainer, Gunn leaps and poses onstage while firing off anecdotes, philosophical asides and more. Movement and monologue are the tools here, employed to galvanizing effect. This performer can shake up an audience with the best of them—her work has the verbal density of a great podcast, but it’s a live, physical experience if there ever was one to be had."},{"id":"1017446","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Reassembled, Slightly Askew | Shannon Yee (Northern Ireland)","description":"An audacious melding of art and science, this multidisciplinary adventure is a head-trip in the literal sense.

The gadgets chime, tap, click and shuffle while the humans move and speak in response. As they lock and shift, the dancers seem driven, almost desperate: the rhythm controls them. This is a triumph of engineering and a work of precision; the design of the instruments, the rigour of the dances and the music itself show a delicate, almost precarious intricacy.For all the mechanical sophistication on display, however, there’s something low-tech, even artisanal, about this show. The instruments are programmed down to the last hit, but their sounds are so palpably organic they can almost be felt as well as heard. Joining touch, sound and motion, MEETING calls on our primal impulses even as it dazzles with its sophistication.

Audience members are seated in a theatre, with a row of children behind them, and together they experience a movie. The film has no dialogue and audience members are blindfolded, with the children describing to them in whispers. It’s a mischievous experiment in storytelling, reversing the traditional power dynamic between adults and children.In this collaboration between adult and child, there are layers of mediation the film moves through; it transforms as it passes from one mind to another. Sight, then speech, then hearing—with each step something is lost. But much more is gained: a bond of trust, the chance to join forces across an age gap, a great widening of the imagination. At the movies, we watch with the lights off. Here the darkness is doubled, and so is the power to dream—to use the silver screen within."},{"id":"1017431","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Reassembled, Slightly Askew | Shannon Yee (Northern Ireland)","description":"An audacious melding of art and science, this multidisciplinary adventure is a head-trip in the literal sense.

She’s created a meditation on her own menstrual cycle—an explosive mixture of the deeply personal and the fiercely political.Ashbee takes the body as her material for metaphor, and her work is one of startling dynamics. At one moment there is rhythm and repetition, at another complete darkness, and the line between beauty and agony becomes blurred.

Her instruments are loop pedals, a drum machine and, of course, the cello: its melodies are plaintive but catchy, growing in number as the song progresses. These hooks repeat like echoes, part of a thick mixture yet distinct within it.Hailing from North Tallcree chiefs on her father’s side and Mennonite homesteaders on her mother’s, Derksen mixes styles like a painter mixes colours.

In her Canadian debut, choreographer Lin Lee-Chen folds age-old rituals, customs and ceremonial rites into her radical vision, and the result is epic. The show is, above all, a tribute to water: the ocean that encloses the island of Taiwan, and the cycle of renewal it is part of. Using song, dance and striking stage design, Lin evokes the mythology of these elements. You might call it spiritual environmentalism—a tribute to nature as it was, and might be again.With its large ensemble of dancers and musicians, the show has an intoxicating power. Lin carries us through a procession of vivid tableaux; the imagery evokes myth and human reality in equal measure. The costumes and sets are stunning: fabric and silver grass, red-tinted figures and shocks of white, composed with flair and delicacy. At once austere and sensual, intimate and monumental, this show will leave you awestruck."},{"id":"1018101","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Daughter | QuipTake &amp; Pandemic Theatre (Canada)","description":"What are you willing to forgive? You’ll find yourself asking that question as you watch comedian Adam Lazarus’s harrowing yet hilarious show. Landing uncomfortably between autobiography and fiction, Daughter is the story of one man’s struggle with love, anger and what’s come to be known as toxic masculinity.As a new dad, Lazarus found himself facing all the usual challenges—and some that are, perhaps, unique to a particular type of man. He loved his daughter, and he tried to be gentle, to be kind, to be good with her… but somehow things went wrong. Looking back on his life, the comedian presents a story of rage, regret and reckoning that will both amuse and shock. Smart, incisive and sincerely remorseful, this is a performer who has learned his lesson—and earned the right to impart a few of his own."},{"id":"1017486","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Reassembled, Slightly Askew | Shannon Yee (Northern Ireland)","description":"An audacious melding of art and science, this multidisciplinary adventure is a head-trip in the literal sense.

It’s an audio experience like no other: re-enactment, internal monologue, evocative aural textures and more.What does it mean for a mind to be injured?

The tale begins with his foray into the wilderness— a place where he seems destined to wander. As the sun starts to set, a new world emerges, and our hero finds himself caught up in a frightening scenario. Danger lurks, and as the light fades things get stranger and stranger.The tools of the trade here are puppetry, animation, shadow play and live performance, and there’s joy in seeing how much the show’s creators can do with what they have. They know that with resourcefulness and the power of suggestion, a complete world can be evoked. In that world a man fights off the dying of the light, and his struggle is turned into the stuff of adventure and redemption. This is a deeply moving work, and a sheer delight for the senses."},{"id":"1017491","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Reassembled, Slightly Askew | Shannon Yee (Northern Ireland)","description":"An audacious melding of art and science, this multidisciplinary adventure is a head-trip in the literal sense.

Strongly associated with obliteration and destruction, nuclear technologies have had a profound cultural and ecological impact since their development in the mid-20th century.Encompassing the pre- and postwar period from the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 to the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in 2011, BOMBHEAD brings together paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, photographs, film and video that deal with this often dark subject matter. The exhibition will address some of the most pressing issues of the postwar era. What has been the role of art in producing an image of the bomb and nuclear energy? Have nuclear art and images heightened or lessened anxieties about the atomic threat, or have they done both simultaneously? How should different expressive approaches to nuclear risk be understood? The themes explored in this exhibition will strongly resonate with the works on view in Takashi Murakami: The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg, which reflect Murakami’s own reckoning with the nuclear age.Artists in the exhibition include: Carl Beam, Henry Busse, Blaine Campbell, Bruce Conner, Gregory Coyes, Robert Del Tredici, Wang Du, Harold Edgerton, Gathie Falk, Robert Filliou, Richard Finnie, Betty Goodwin, Adolph Gottlieb, Richard Harrington, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Robert Keziere, Roy Kiyooka, Bob Light and John Houston, Ishiuchi Miyako, Carel Moiseiwitsch, Andrea Pinheiro, Robert Rauschenberg, Mark Ruwedel, John Scott, Erin Siddall, Nancy Spero and Barbara Todd.","geometry":{"location":{"lat":49.2830077,"lng":-123.1208179},"viewport":{"northeast":{"lat":49.28435668029149,"lng":-123.1194689197085},"southwest":{"lat":49.2816587197085,"lng":-123.1221668802915}},"location_type":"ROOFTOP"},"formatted_address":"750 Hornby St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 2H7, Canada"},{"id":"1017586","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Reassembled, Slightly Askew | Shannon Yee (Northern Ireland)","description":"An audacious melding of art and science, this multidisciplinary adventure is a head-trip in the literal sense.

This production is a work of radical upheaval, in which the King Arthur legend is made fresh for our eyes. Merlin, Lancelot, Guinevere—they’re all present in this tale of love, honour and war. New to us are the live band, the 20-person choir and, most of all, the radically inclusive cast.The players in this drama, all professional, include people whose life experience includes Down syndrome. They stand on stage defined by their extraordinary perspectives. Playwrights and performers Niall McNeil, playing our eponymous hero, and Marcus Youssef have collaborated to write a show that will defy expectations and, hopefully, create new ones. Their art is original and personal, but it feels as necessary as the classic literature it draws on: they want to change theatre, and they want theatre to change us."},{"id":"1018056","tags":["Performing Arts","Theatre"],"name":"Pour | Daina Ashbee (Canada)","description":"In choreographer Daina Ashbee’s fiercely provocative feminist work, dancer Paige Culley coils and uncoils as she works her way around the stage. In her nudity, she is both vulnerable and powerful. The exertions have the look of ritual, and that’s just what Ashbee has in mind. She’s created a meditation on her own menstrual cycle—an explosive mixture of the deeply personal and the fiercely political.Ashbee takes the body as her material for metaphor, and her work is one of startling dynamics. At one moment there is rhythm and repetition, at another complete darkness, and the line between beauty and agony becomes blurred. For all her obsession with pain, however, the creator takes unflinching pride in the female body. Haunting, visceral and unsparing, this is a work that calls not so much for spectators as for witnesses."}]

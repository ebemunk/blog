  // element’s bound datum, d.endAngle), and the ending angle (simply the

    // single argument t and returns a number between the starting angle and the
    // ending angle. When t = 0, it returns d.endAngle; when t = 1, it returns

    // "d" attribute at every tick. (It’s also possible to use transition.tween
    // to run arbitrary code for every tick, say if you want to set multiple
    // attributes from a single function.) The argument t ranges from 0, at the
    // start of the transition, to 1, at the end.

      // the t for the transition and the t for the interpolate both range from
      // 0 to 1, we can pass t directly to the interpolator.

      // Note that the interpolated angle is written into the element’s bound
      // data object! This is important: it means that if the transition were
      // interrupted, the data bound to the element would still be consistent
      // with its appearance. Whenever we start a new arc transition, the
      // correct starting angle can be inferred from the data.

      // transition uses data-space interpolation: the data is interpolated
      // (that is, the end angle) rather than the path string itself.
      // Interpolating the angles in polar coordinates, rather than the raw path
      // string, produces valid intermediate arcs during the transition.

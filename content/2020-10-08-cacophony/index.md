I always get glimpses of cool ideas when I see great data, and after watching parts of the First Presidential Debate of 2020 I knew I had to do something with it. The transcript over at [Rev.com](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020) contains incredibly detailed and millisecond timestamped data.

Hearing about how chaotic the debate went (and witnessing it after digging into the data), I wanted to look at how often people spoke over each other.

As I was making the pie charts, I thought why not try a polar version - maybe it'll make for better visual interest.

Interested in prints of these graphics? I have a few copies printed on beautiful art paper. Reach out on twitter.

I wanted to do something like this for a long time, and finally I think it's at a point where I can release this into the wild.

## Meta
<div id="word-count"></div>

<script src="http://localhost:9001/bundle.js"></script>
<script>
  window.loadData()
  window.renderTo('WordCount', '#word-count')
</script>

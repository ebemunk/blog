## Branching Factor

> [Tobias Voelk](http://disq.us/p/1uff75d):
> Hey, could you add another statistic: The distribution of the number of moves from a position. I know the average is roughly around 35-40, but what does the distribution look like? Is it a Gauss curve?

> [Kai Middleton](http://disq.us/p/16vm2pd):
> Another idea: I'd like to see the average branching factor at move n.

## GameEndMaterialCount / GameEndMaterialDiff

> [mike](http://disq.us/p/163f78u):
> I think it would be interesting to see whats the difference in material when the game end in relation to the total played moves.

> [Chessplayer](http://disq.us/p/1tok1va):
> This is cool! I would love to see a graph of the exchange versus the result of the game.

## More Heatmaps

tote agree

> [Warren Smith](http://disq.us/p/1sggdtc):
> Make heat maps for promotion squares to RBNQ and en passant capture squares.
> Make checkmate-square and stalemate-square heat maps. A more sophisticated programming project would be to compute checkmating "patterns" and display all the most frequent ones.

## Opening popularity

[Sean McCain](http://disq.us/p/1674etx):
I love the heat map! But I was wondering if you thought of adding a time slider to the openings tree, so you could move it and see the how popular openings (and opening theory) changes over time?

## Pawn paths

[zvranic](http://disq.us/p/1nh5lyr):
Also, I would really like to see abstract art for pawns which does not include journeys after promotion. It would be really interesting to see which pawns get promoted most and how far side-wise can they go. Thanks!

## Wins w negative material

[mark](http://disq.us/p/1629wrr):
I'd also like to see the Opening map cross-referenced with wins but negative material. Perhaps you could even discover wins-by-sacrifice looking for a major material change and a win?

What can I find among the crashes? Working on this project was quite eye opening for me, and I hope it gives you something to think about as well. Let's go.

## One Century of Aviation Safety

As we look deeper into this dataset, I would ask you to keep in mind that we are focusing exclusively on crashes. The statistics, therefore, are closely tied to only the flights that end in crashes. The big picture to remind yourself is that this is a tiny portion of successful flights that occur on the daily. In 2018, which was somewhat of an outlier in itself, there were about [1 crash per 300 million flights](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/02/plane-crash-deaths-jump-sharply-in-2018-but-fatalities-still-rare). [The odds of being struck by lightning](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds) **twice** in your lifetime is still 20% higher than being in a flight that's involved in a crash.

## Fatalities

Focusing on fatalities seem like a morbid curiosity; examining the terrifying and tragic deaths caused by plane crashes seems almost insulting. I was hesitant to look at this until I saw the numbers. Beyond the big crashes that make the news and are emblazed in our minds as the great tragedies they are, looking at it from this perspective is almost reassuring.

## Flight Phases

I wanted to know if there was a "most dangerous" phase of a flight, and any relation to crashes or fatalities.

## Nature

Here's a table showing the many different "natures" of flights. It's notable that the majority of the flights are for military purposes. Seeing the percentage of crashes in relation to their nature and the average fatalities for that category was eye opening for me.

## Outro

I hope this gave you a new perspective on aviation and flight safety. If you're into the history, statistics or trivia, I would love to hear from you in the comments. What else can you determine from these visualizations? What else does this make you wonder about? I welcome any discussion and thoughts you have.

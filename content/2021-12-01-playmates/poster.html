        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Demographics breakdown of the Print (magazine) and Online
          (playboy.com) versions from 2004 self-reported by Playboy. Playboy
          describes print readers as
          <strong>"brand conscious"</strong>,
          <strong>"outdoor enthusiasts"</strong>,
          <strong>"trendsetters"</strong> and
          <strong>"socially active"</strong>. Online readers are
          <strong>"tech savvy"</strong>, <strong>"gamers"</strong>,
          <strong>"online shoppers"</strong> and
          <strong>"active & adventurous"</strong>. Some numbers don't add up to
          100%!

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Age</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          There has been an <strong>increase of about 4 years</strong> in the
          ages of Playmates since the first issue. Eight Playmates were under
          the age of 18 when photographed, and Hefner was arrested in one
          instance, but released.
        </div>
        <div id="viz-scrolly-age" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Height</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle"><strong>5% increase</strong> in height.</div>
        <div id="viz-scrolly-height" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Weight</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Weight has similarly seen an <strong>increase of about 8%</strong>
          . The average weight after Hefner's death strays sharply from the
          average prior, strongly suggesting Hefner favored women of a certain
          size.

        <div id="viz-scrolly-weight" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Bust</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          There has been a significant drop in bust sizes,
          <strong>9.6% decrease</strong> overall. This is interesting, because
          most sources online claim that bust size, especially in the US has
          actually <em>gone up</em>.
        </div>
        <div id="viz-scrolly-bust" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Waist</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Having a smaller waist is the most statistically significant
          distinction between Playmates and the US average.
        </div>
        <div id="viz-scrolly-waist" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Hips</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          20% of the Playmates had larger hips in the period after Hefner's
          death than at any other point in the magazine's history.
        </div>
        <div id="viz-scrolly-hips" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Hair</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          In the US, having light hair has become the "beauty standard," with
          48% of White college women dyeing their hair blond or blonder. A
          survey in 2003 reported that only 4% of adults in the US are naturally
          blond.

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Cosmetic Enhancements</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Essential to the conversation surrounding Playboy's view of beauty is
          the lengths that many individuals went to achieve it. Cosmetic
          enhancements by way of surgical procedures are quite common among
          Playmates.
        </div>
        <div id="viz-scrolly-enhancements" class="viz up"></div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Ethnicity</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Historically, the magazine has reinforced the colonizer perspective
          and constructs the "All-American Beauty" as a blond, skinny, white
          woman, with 90% of its Playmates being white. It featured a single
          Black woman for the first time in 1965, and it did not feature a Black
          woman again for four years. Only 2019 and 2020 had 40% non-white
          Playmates, the most it has ever been in its 67-year history.

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Breaking the mold</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          2020 is the first and only year the hourglass-figure mold was broken.
          Bust measurements decline through the decades, waist and hips
          increase. What some call curvy or "thick" is finally welcomed by
          Playboy in 2020. The "Ideal" 36-24-36 shown in cyan. Projected
          dimensions of the Barbie doll in yellow.

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">BMI - Straddling the line</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          More than half of Playmates are Underweight, 48% are in the Healthy
          range. There are only 2 other Playmates (&lt;1%) in any other
          category. The difference of the averages between US women and
          Playmates is staggering.
        </div>
        <div id="viz-bmi" class="viz"></div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">The Magic Number</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          A Waist-to-Hip Ratio of 0.7, which accounts for ~20% of Playmates is
          said to be the "perfect" ratio for attractiveness. Highlighted are the
          "most attractive" WHRs from other cultures/places. No Playmate has
          ever been above 1.0 WHR.
        </div>

      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Birthplace of Playmates</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Only 18% of Playmates were born outside of the US. Focus on the
          regions of the world where no Playmate was born in.
        </div>
        <div id="viz-birthplace" class="viz"></div>

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Californication</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          West coast - best coast for Playmates. Vermont and Delaware are the
          only states that have never had Playmates.

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Most/Least Average Playmates</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Playmates ordered by their distance to the average Playmate. The most
          and least average top 5 Playmates split the age of the magazine into
          almost perfect quarters. The top 5 most average are from older issues,
          whereas the top 5 least average are from 2003 and later.

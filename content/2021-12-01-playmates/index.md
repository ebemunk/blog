**Since the subject matter is Playboy and their Playmates of the Month, you should beware that most links will be NSFW. I've taken care to <u>not have any NSFW content on this post</u>.**

The two primary sources for the data here is [mypmates.club](https://mypmates.club/) and [Babepedia](https://www.babepedia.com/). Babepedia has a bit more information, whereas mypmates seems to be a Playboy affiliate site. When there were disagreements about the data, I went with the values in mypmates.

## Who Reads Playboy?

Turns out, Playboy is not very transparent with their demographics (not sure if this is common among other magazines). But, I did find some information about who reads playboy on their own [media kit from 2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20041019143228/https://www.playboy.com/mediakit/print_demographics.html). More than a decade later, obviously these values are outdated, but I think it gives a bit of context into _who Playboy is meant for_.

Playboy also has information for their [online demographics](https://web.archive.org/web/20041022052012/http://www.playboy.com/mediakit/online_demographics.html). The values here are inconsistent, and combined with it's age, it's best to take these with a huge grain of salt.

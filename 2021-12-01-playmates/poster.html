          Some issues featured more than 1 Playmate. All Playmates, except for
          the first time it happened, share more than the Playmate title. They
          share DNA! Explore the interactive viz for a deep dive.

        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Average age of Playmates increased by almost 20% over the years. Read
          more about the 7 Playmates who were underage when photographed, and
          what happened to Hugh Hefner in one case when found out.

        <div class="viz-title">The Weighting Game</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          No Playmate was above 150lbs until 2020. It took 66 years for Playboy
          to pick a Playmate that's at the US Average for weight. Note how the
          variance explodes after Hefner's death. 3 outliers tell a story of
          embracing body acceptance.

      <div>
        <div class="viz-title">Waist circumference</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          With an 11% increase, waist measurements went up the most over the
          years. 70% of the Playmates measuring more than 28" came after
          Hefner's passing. Still, the US average would not fit in this chart.
          Waist measurement is the farthest from US average from any other
          measurement.

        <div class="viz-title">Hips don't lie</div>
        <div class="viz-subtitle">
          Though it only increased by 2%, this also highlights how the "new
          Playboy" values Playmates' characteristics differently than Hugh
          Hefner.

          Even though it touts a progressive stance, only 2 most recent years
          have featured around 40% non-white Playmates. Do you think this
          mirrors Playboy's demographics?

I find their list extremely useful and use it all the time to find cool things to do, and notice a great deal of events happening all over the city. I collected all the events over the course of 2018 and wanted to make a &amp;ldquo;map of the city&amp;rdquo; from this data.</description></item><item><title>Text Mining LOST</title><link>https://blog.ebemunk.com/lost-text-mining/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ebemunk.com/lost-text-mining/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re text mining the transcripts of the TV show LOST, and visualizing them!
I retrieved and parsed the transcripts of LOST from Lostpedia1 and used a few different tools to look at this data.
One thing to keep in mind is that this analysis is on only the text that the characters speak. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big LOST connoisseur, so take these visualizations at their face value and not as some objective judgement about your favorite LOST character or writer.</description></item><item><title>A Visual Look at 2 Million Chess Games</title><link>https://blog.ebemunk.com/a-visual-look-at-2-million-chess-games/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2016 11:18:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ebemunk.com/a-visual-look-at-2-million-chess-games/</guid><description>I wanted to do something like this for a long time, and finally I think it&amp;rsquo;s at a point where I can release this into the wild.
We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at more than 2 million games, taken from the MillionBase PGN database. I ignored any Chess960 games contained, but in total there are 2,197,113 games. I was interested to see what kind of visualizations I can do, and what patterns would be revealed by considering so many games.</description></item></channel></rss>

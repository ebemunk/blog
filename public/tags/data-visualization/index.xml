      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re looking at the year of 2018 in Vancouver through the lens of event listings on the Georgia Straight Events 1 page. I find their list extremely useful and use it all the time to find cool things to do, and notice a great deal of events happening all over the city. I have collected all the events over the course of 2018 and wanted to make a &amp;ldquo;map of the city&amp;rdquo; from this data.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re text mining the transcripts of the TV show LOST, and visualizing them!
I wondered how much the dialogue text contributes to a TV show, and whether you would be able to &amp;ldquo;detect&amp;rdquo; things in it, looking only at the words that the characters speak, removed from how their actors looked or sounded like. How much of the writing shows through and contributes, especially in this &amp;ldquo;mass production&amp;rdquo; mentality of similar entertainment media?</description>

      <description>I wanted to do something like this for a long time, and finally I think it&amp;rsquo;s at a point where I can release this into the wild.
We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at more than 2 million games, taken from the MillionBase PGN database. I ignored any Chess960 games contained, but in total there are 2,197,113 games. I was interested to see what kind of visualizations I can do, and what patterns would be revealed by considering so many games.</description>

Texas carries out the majority of these executions, having executed more people than the next top 6 states combined.</description></item><item><title>Text Mining LOST</title><link>https://blog.ebemunk.com/lost-text-mining/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ebemunk.com/lost-text-mining/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re text mining the transcripts of the TV show LOST, and visualizing them!
I retrieved and parsed the transcripts of LOST from Lostpedia and used a few different tools to look at this data.
One thing to keep in mind is that this analysis is on only the text that the characters speak. I&amp;rsquo;m not a LOST connoisseur, and haven&amp;rsquo;t seen all the episodes. I&amp;rsquo;m not an authority on LOST, or on text mining.</description></item></channel></rss>

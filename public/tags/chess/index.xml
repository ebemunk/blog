      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re looking deeper into the amazing MillionBase database with over two million chess games to see what else we can learn about the data specifically, and possibly about chess in general. I have analyzed some of this data in Part 1. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen that, feel free to give it a read.
This post will focus on other aspects of the data, and I have drawn from some reader suggestions from the previous post.</description>

      <description>I wanted to do something like this for a long time, and finally I think it&amp;rsquo;s at a point where I can release this into the wild.
We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at more than 2 million games, taken from the MillionBase PGN database. I ignored any Chess960 games contained, but in total there are 2,197,113 games. I was interested to see what kind of visualizations I can do, and what patterns would be revealed by considering so many games.</description>

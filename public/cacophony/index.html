The transcript over at <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020">Rev.com</a> contains incredibly detailed and millisecond timestamped data.</p>
<p>Hearing about how chaotic the debate went (and witnessing it after digging into the data), I wanted to look at how often people spoke over each other.</p>
